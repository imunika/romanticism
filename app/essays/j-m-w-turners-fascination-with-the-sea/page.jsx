            Joseph Mallord William Turner

          was born in London in 1775 and went on to become one of England's most
          famous landscape painters. He began studying at the{" "}

          when he was just fourteen years old. Soon afterwards, in 1790, he
          exhibited his watercolors at the annual summer exhibition of the
          prestigious{" "}

            Royal Academy of Arts
          </a>
          . Later, in 1796, he submitted his first oil painting to the Academy's
          exhibition. He would continue to present his art at the Academy for
          several years afterwards and in 1799, he was elected an Associate
          Member of the Academy (he also taught perspective at the Academy for
          some time). Turner had an unforgettable impact on Romanticism. He
          changed ideas about light and color, which would leave lasting
          impressions on the technique of painting. His work would go on to
          inspire countless artists. The way he painted with oil made it look
          like he was using watercolor, which revealed the true mastery behind
          his work. His art was truly a spectacular sight to see.

        <p className="indent-8">
          The public could see many of Turner's works, especially his large oil
          paintings because upon his death he donated around a hundred of his
          finished oil paintings to the{" "}

          in London. These did not make up all of the art he created in the over
          fifty years he was active. Turner also had a gallery in the West End
          where he would present his art. The gallery doubled as his studio.
          When he died, he did not leave his studio to anyone in his will. This
          meant that there were no clear owners of his property and most
          importantly, there were no clear heirs to his works of art. The art he
          left behind became a part of the Turner Bequest of 1856 that resulted
          in a legal battle within Turner's extended family. His studio in the
          West End gallery held over 19,000 drawings, watercolor studies, and
          other sketches and work on paper plus 180 unfinished oil paintings.
          Many of the pieces from the Turner Bequest can now be viewed in{" "}

        <p className="indent-8">
          Many of the watercolor sketches in Turner's studio were called "color
          beginnings" (Riding and Johns, 78) and were departure points for his
          oil paintings. They were usually watercolor sketches that focused on
          the color palette of the landscape he was planning to compose. There
          is so much history behind every work of art, even if it was a sketch
          that the artist never intended to show to the public. This is true for
          the <i>Untitled Seascape</i> by J.M.W. Turner in the collections of
          the Syracuse University Art Galleries. It may not be one of his
          spectacular oil paintings, but it is nonetheless a rare watercolor
          that was likely one of his "color beginnings" for a much bigger
          composition.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          The date of the watercolor in Syracuse is unknown. Due to its small
          size (5 11/16 x 7 15/16 inches), we can surmise that it was probably
          from one of Turner's sketchbooks. Turner was almost never without a
          sketchbook and pencil. He would constantly paint while traveling,
          making quick watercolor sketches of the landscapes that surrounded
          him. Unmistakably a Turner, the picture depicts a calm colored sea
          with a beautiful strip of cobalt blue along the horizon line. But the
          sky gives us a different story. The clouds are a dark grey, possibly
          marking a storm that has just passed through or is incoming. There is
          also a swathe of reddish orange in the bottom left corner that
          suggests the sun is beginning to set. Possibly the most striking part
          is the tiny blue silhouette of a ship in the center of the distant
          horizon. It is difficult to detect at first glance because it blends
          completely into the blue of the sea. Upon close scrutiny, one can also
          find Turner's initials in the bottom right corner of the sketch.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-8">
          <i>Untitled Seascape</i> reminds us of many of Turner's watercolor
          sketches focused on the sea. His{" "}

          (after 1825) share similarities in composition and colors.{" "}
          <i>Beach and Sailboat</i> share the beautiful strip of blue as the
          horizon line. There is a tiny ship on the left side of the page, also
          painted a pale blue that blends into the water. The painting is about
          the ocean first, then the ship, much like our untitled sketch. The{" "}
          <i>Sailboat</i> looks like a much more spontaneous watercolor. Each
          facet of the painting seems to have been executed with haste. The sea
          is a few quick swipes of the brush with the color gray. The red strip
          of the sunset on the horizon bleeds into the gray stormy sky. A line
          of blue, which seeps into the red, marks the horizon. The final detail
          is a boat that is simply a quick squiggle that teeters on the left
          side of the painting. It gives us a glimpse of Turner's sketching
          methods. It also reveals the artist's sheer talent—he was able to
          capture the scene at hand with just a few swipes of his brush. Both{" "}
          <i>Beach and Sailboat</i> and <i>Sailboat</i> also demonstrate a
          method Turner used called "wet-on-wet" for which he would wet the page
          he was painting on so that all the colors would bleed into each other.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-8">
          The sketch in the SUArt Galleries is also very reminiscent of one of
          Turner's most famous works,{" "}

          (1840) in the{" "}

            Museum of Fine Arts
          </a>{" "}
          in Boston. This large oil painting is comprised of brilliant reds and
          yellows that reflect the setting sun in the sky as one sees a ship
          drifting into a storm. In the sea are limbs of drowning slaves
          depicted in the foreground. Bodies have just been dumped into the
          unforgiving sea. Here, the turbulent sea presents a sharp contrast to
          the calm waters in the untitled watercolor we have in our collection,
          but the similarities between the coloring suggest that the sketch may
          have been a study for the <i>Slave Ship</i>.

        <p className="indent-8">
          Turner would often use preliminary sketches to compose his larger oil
          paintings. A specific example of how <i>Untitled Seascape</i> sketch
          may have been a preliminary study for a larger composition, is his{" "}

          in the Tate collections. Both the print and the sketch reveal how
          Turner planned to portray the sweeping waves and how the ship would be
          swept under the water in the mezzotint. <i>Untitled Seascape</i> was
          thus likely to be just one of his countless studies that Turner made
          of the ocean.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          As I have mentioned earlier, the sketch in Syracuse could have lived
          in one of Turner's many sketchbooks. For instance, his{" "}
          <a

            Ambleteuse and Wimereux sketchbook
          </a>{" "}
          is filled with several studies for his oil paintings. Turner used
          these preliminary sketches to focus on certain parts of the landscape
          that he wanted to study more closely. Indeed, the Ambleteuse and
          Wimereux sketchbook features many of his maritime studies. In it we
          find sketches depicting the colors of a whale being harpooned, the
          effects of the sunset at Ambleteuse, and the difference between active
          storm clouds at sea and ones that were fanning out and away. Given the
          sheer number of studies Turner made of the ocean during his lifetime,
          it is difficult to pinpoint the exact sketchbook to which the
          watercolor in Syracuse belongs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Turner's <i>Untitled Seascape</i> portrays many classic motifs of
          Romanticism. The sky takes up most of the picture space and it is
          reflected in the ocean. The clouds are dark and have a sense of
          foreboding. The ship in the center of the page goes almost unnoticed
          until we look closely at the image. The sketch shows the power of the
          ocean and how small and powerless man is compared to it. It is vast
          and unforgiving, yet beautiful. Nature is the focal point and the ship
          is a reminder of humankind's fragility.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          It is understandable why the ocean transfixed Turner in such a way.
          Having lived thirty minutes away from the Pacific Ocean my entire life
          I know that no visit to the sea is quite like the last. The waves can
          be forty feet high one day crashing like thunder, and lazily lapping
          at your feet the next. The absolute power the ocean holds is
          universally understood. Even now when the ocean threatens to flood and
          swallow up the very land that we have claimed as our home. Ocean
          levels rising prove that humans are not more powerful than nature, but
          rather that we are and always will be helpless when it turns against
          us.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Nature will destroy us in order to survive and we will not be able to
          outlast it. The earth does not care about the human race; we are
          merely its inhabitants. We are looking at the same ocean Turner
          painted, but he never had to bear witness to how humanity was going to
          ruin it. There used to be a slogan that "the solution to pollution is
          dilution," and this led to vats of chemical waste being dumped into
          the water since the 1970s (Kashi). Now we know that this is not a
          solution. Every summer a New Jersey-sized "dead zone" forms in the
          Mississippi River Delta because of our dumping waste into the river.
          And there is also the Texas-sized (and growing) plastic "island" that
          has formed in the middle of the Pacific Ocean due to our inability to
          stop using single-use plastics. Humans are destroying our oceans
          partially because some of us just do not care and partially because
          governments all around the world are generally unwilling to stop
          creating so much waste. People care much more about production and
          profit and therefore fail to realize that our means of production is
          causing our planet permanent harm. Countries like China and the USA
          create so much waste while ignoring the facts of climate change. Even
          the President of the United States undermines the impact of climate
          change. Turner's paintings should act as a reminder of how beautiful
          marine life is and they should prompt people in power around the world
          to take action so that our oceans are protected.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          The pollution we are creating is ruining nature, the very nature that
          inspired the Romantics and captured their imagination. Human beings
          are trying to conquer nature and in doing so we are ruining our own
          home, our planet. We should begin to appreciate nature again like the
          Romantics once did. If we don't, it could be ruined by our own selfish
          endeavors.
