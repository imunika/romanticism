          I remember how jarring it was the first time I saw a mounted police
          officer trotting down 42nd street among the honking taxis of New York.
          It felt like two worlds colliding in a near comical way. Not only did
          it seem to me like an inefficient and expensive mode of transport — I
          saw it as a representation of our country’s habit of clinging to
          expired traditions out of a sense of blind sentimentality. And perhaps
          my first opinion wasn’t completely inaccurate. While statistics might
          suggest the comparable effectiveness of mounted forces to other forms
          of policing, I discovered what truly makes the mounted officers
          unique: their public image. Mounted officers appear more trustworthy,
          more capable, and more approachable than their vehicled counterparts.
          According to one New York Police Officer, “Nobody ever tried to pet my
          police car, but they line up to pet my horse” (Cooper, 2011). The
          public trusts these officers more, and are more likely to report
          suspicious activity to a mounted officer rather than to one on foot.
          But why is this?

        <p className="indent-8">
          Flashback 200 years ago to the turn of the nineteenth century in
          Europe — at the cusp of the Romantic Era of French Art. Think of the
          famous 1805 oil painting Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis
          David, the original version of, which currently resides in the Château
          de Malmaison in France. The oil painting features the small emperor
          clad in garish military regalia, in the midst of climbing his way
          through the Alps atop a rearing horse. The epitome of the “equestrian
          portrait” genre during that time, the picture went on to become the
          most reproduced image of Napoleon. The painting fell easily into the
          “mainstream” — it was very well-received by the public and given a
          stamp of approval by the French Academy of Fine Arts, the “who’s-who”
          of art in France during the time. The painting’s popularity reflected
          what the public wanted and what the government approved of. It was
          propaganda at its best. David chose to depict Napoleon mounted, and
          though the horse takes up more visual space than even Napoleon
          himself, the animal is more a prop than a character, a visual tool to
          accentuate Napoleon’s strength and regal pose. The horse is
          frightened, the whites of its eyes exposed and its mouth agape in
          stark comparison to the emperor’s composure and stern expression. We
          are made to think: Napoleon has the control here — control over the
          horse and the situation. In this portrait, David carefully defines
          Napoleon’s public image through a series of visual signs that
          emphasize the emperor as masculine, capable, and intelligent. Napoleon
          cuts an intimidating figure, here — almost cold. Not necessarily one I
          would feel inclined to approach, but one that I would trust to defend
          my nation. And the horse, in the end, blends into the background
          alongside the mountains and stormy sky.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          But the use of the horse makes sense here. In the early nineteenth
          century, animals were simply utilitarian. Transportation modes were
          limited at best, and so horses, mules, and bulls fulfilled the need to
          move as efficiently as possible. And that bled into their depiction in
          art. Napoleon’s horse isn’t a figure we are meant to sympathize with,
          and it isn’t included to make Napoleon seem more personable. Just the
          opposite, in fact. It emphasizes Napoleon’s authority and power.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          It wasn’t until Romanticism began to truly flourish years later that
          artists became interested in their ability to deploy nature to mirror
          human emotion. Animals exist in a sensate world, unobstructed by human
          rules and regulations. Because of this, animals can become vehicles
          for exploring primal fears and emotions that human beings are taught
          to suppress or ignore. As for the Romantics, the horse especially
          became a unique “image of superhuman energy” (Vaughn, 238). Imbued
          with the wild and untameable instincts of a beast, yet elegant and
          noble, the horse emerged as one of the most popular subjects for the
          animalier — or “animal painter” in nineteenth-century France (Vaughn,
          256).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Enter Eugène Delacroix, one of the most famous French Romantic
          artists. Intensely interested in “images of suffering, insanity,
          violence, and imminent death,” Delacroix often depicted different
          human states in a startling manner highly contrary to the accepted
          styles of the French Academy at that time (Art Institute of Chicago).
          His emphasis on the horse as a subject in his paintings and
          lithographs exemplify his interest in the Sublime. For the Romantics,
          and for Delacroix especially, nature was the ultimate source of the
          Sublime. It was in nature that one witnessed something that left the
          viewer so shaken in equal parts awe and terror that one was utterly
          consumed by nature’s impact. And for Delacroix, no part of nature
          better epitomized the Sublime than the horse, due to its “capacity for
          human terror” (Open Learn).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          A beautiful example of the Sublime intermingled with the mysterious—
          so crucial to Romanticism—is Delacroix’s print, Wild Horse or
          Frightened Horse Leaving the Water in the collection of the Syracuse
          University Art Galleries. The black and white image is highly
          reminiscent of a graphite drawing and features a single horse startled
          by an unspecified noise. It also appears to be placed within an
          atmospheric nightscape. Delacroix’s near-erratic use of line solidly
          breaks away from the careful styles accepted by the Royal Academy, and
          yet elegantly captures the horse’s sense of panic and motion as it
          swiftly exits the body of water, startled by some noise beyond the
          confines of the paper. Our attention is solely on the horse caught in
          the middle of this conflict. We are unsure if it is about to escape or
          be eaten as Delacroix depicts this unresolved moment between life and
          death. No longer is the horse a one-dimensional prop for some piece of
          Napoleonic propaganda. Gone is any trace of “glorious” mankind — and
          yet, the human experience permeates throughout. We are afraid for the
          horse because we sympathize with its fear. Delacroix projects the
          human experience onto this animal. He emphasizes its vulnerability by
          removing all traces of the horse as a symbol of masculinity and
          prestige, while still referencing the animal’s power in the careful
          consideration of muscle and tendon. Delacroix revisited the horse as a
          symbol of the Sublime over and over again in prints like his Lion
          Devouring a Horse (1844), Wild Horse Brought Down by a Tiger (1828),
          and Fallen Horse and Dead Knight (1827-29).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          By dismantling the horse as a symbol of man’s power over nature and
          intrinsic dominance, and instead emphasizing the similarities between
          human and animal, perhaps Delacroix was criticizing the trends of
          propaganda art so popular in France at the time. John Steuart Curry is
          an artist who felt a similar resentment towards propaganda art. He
          borrowed the very Romantic trend that Delacroix used of horses as
          vehicles for the Sublime in his 1930 lithograph Horses Running Before
          a Storm featuring another black and white scene of a cloudscape. A
          massive fork of lightning touches down in a vast field behind four
          startled horses racing away from the storm brewing in the distance. It
          is interesting to see almost exactly a century later, another artist
          from a completely different background carrying on the Romantic
          tradition of depicting horses as exemplars of the Sublime – majestic
          and graceful, yet vulnerable and easily frightened.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          In Delacroix’s time, industrialization was just beginning to take hold
          in Europe. For people living in the nineteenth century, the future
          boasted a system of transportation reliant on steam powerrather than
          horsepower. As Romanticism slowly began to set the visual guidelines
          for art in France and the Sublime became of greater interest to the
          public, the horse’s role in society also shifted. No longer an
          unfeeling animal separated from human experience, the horse would
          become a mirror through which humanity saw its own flaws, strengths,
          and fears. Furthermore, in today’s automated world, horseback riding
          is very much a remnant of the past — now considered more of a hobby or
          a ceremonial procedure than a viable method of transport. Horses
          generally represent some untamed and noble part of nature that we as
          humans have lost over the years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Back to those streets in New York where horse mounted officers make
          their way through the crowds. What remains of the romantic equine
          notions of the Sublime? Why do we spend hundreds of thousands of
          dollars annually to fund a police group founded on an outdated and
          seeming efficient mode of transportation? Police cars are less
          expensive, but are dead, metal objects. They are man-made, and perhaps
          we project some of man’s own arrogance onto the car when we see it
          driving down the street. But a horse is a living, breathing, animal —
          and a relationship with a horse is not simply one of ownership.
          Officers spend months in rigorous training in order to learn the
          skills and craft a bond with the animal they are riding. And those
          bonds are taken into account very seriously when matching an officer
          with his mount. There is a trust between animal and human that carries
          weight, especially since we are very much still attached to the
          romantic idea that horses themselves are moral and majestic creatures.
          The process of matching with a steed requires dedication, patience,
          and even love towards the animal. If an officer is cruel to the
          animal, they won’t earn its trust. And the public knows this.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          The sight of an officer on a horse is highly reminiscent of the
          military portraits of Napoleon and others, and yet has lost the
          overpoweringly threatening undertones — perhaps since the horse is no
          longer a military “vehicle”. The romantic notion of “horse” has
          forever changed our relationship with the creature. In
          nineteenth-century France, the rise of industrialization ensured that
          nature became subservient to the demands of humankind. It became
          something to be tamed in the name of human progress. Romanticism was
          very much a response to that — a rebellion against it. The Romantics —
          Delacroix included — saw nature as something more powerful than man
          could ever be. And for Delacroix, no symbol better exemplified
          nature’s majesty than the horse. In our never-ceasing world of
          progress and expansion, we are again seeing a rebellion against the
          idea that nature is tameable. Perhaps a mounted police force is an
          unnecessary remnant of the past. But it could also be an excellent
          example of the way artistic trends throughout history have defined and
          redefined society’s relationship to the natural world.
