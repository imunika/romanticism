            Eugène Delacroix
          </a>
          , considered one of the masters of Romanticism, is well known for his
          handling of color and movement, as well as for his talent for creating
          large, dynamic paintings filled with tension and excitement. This is
          evident in his most popular works such as{" "}

            <em>The Death of Sardanapalus</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1827). By contrast to these epic masterpieces modelled after the
          history painting tradition, Delacroix’s <em>Étude de Femme</em>, or{" "}
          <em>Study of a Woman</em>, an etching completed in 1830, is an
          intimate, personal work of art that speaks to a different
          tradition—that of the female nude. Delacroix’s print differs from
          other works in his career, and serves as a node in a very long and
          evolving discourse about the representation and symbolism of the
          female nude in western European art.

             The nude is one of the most popular and famous symbols in European
          art, and the female nude has a particular allure that has stood the
          test of time. From the classical era of ancient Greece to modern day
          photography and film, the female nude is an incredibly popular
          subject. How it has evolved over time redirects us to how women,
          sexuality, and the human body have been viewed at various times in
          history. While the female nude was popular in ancient Greece, it was a
          very rare subject in the middle ages. This changed during the
          Renaissance. In 1510 in Italy the painter Giorgione painted his{" "}
          <em>Sleeping Venus</em>, a fully-frontal nude woman sleeping in an
          idyllic landscape. The title is key here: it is Venus, the goddess of
          love. We are looking at a mythical figure in the painting, not at a
          mortal woman. For a human woman to be seen naked was considered
          sinful, scandalous, and dangerous, but in the form of a goddess, she
          was seen as pure. As a result, female nudes, however intimate and real
          looking, were named after immortal figures from Greek and Roman
          mythology. Titian’s{" "}
          <a

            target="_blank"
          >
            <em>Venus of Urbino</em>
          </a>
          , or <em>Reclining Venus</em> completed in 1538, are examples that
          would go on to influence later representations of Venus-like figures.
          These paintings adhered to the rules of decorum regarding classical
          art and set the standard for representing the female form unclothed.

        <p className="indent-8">
             Delacroix’s etching and where it fits in the trajectory of what the
          female nude becomes, is bookended by two paintings: Diego Velázquez’s{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/diego-velazquez-the-toilet-of-venus-the-rokeby-venus"
            target="_blank"
          >
            <em>Rokeby Venus</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1647-51) and Edouard Manet’s{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/artworks/olympia-712"
            target="_blank"
          >
            <em>Olympia</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1863). The painting that arguably best embodies the many classical
          traditions of Venus in the nude is Velázquez’s <em>Rokeby Venus</em>,
          or <em>The Toilet of Venus</em>. Velázquez has combined the existing
          traditions of a reclining nude with a nude looking at herself in a
          mirror. However, the <em>Rokeby Venus</em> is noticeably more intimate
          and personal than the more traditional nudes found in classical
          antiquity. Venus is not adorned with excessive jewels and has a simple
          brown bun rather than flowing golden hair. To this end, the image is
          far closer to reality perhaps than its idealized visual precedents.
          Despite the more personal and realistic setting, the nude at this time
          could not be about any normal everyday woman. She had to be recast as
          Venus. Velázquez’s Venus turns away from us, hiding her breasts, and
          is only able to see the viewer secondhand through a mirror, while
          maintaining some level of modesty. While Velázquez has crafted a very
          intimate, beautiful, and personal portrait, it is still protected by
          the veneer of a classical subject in its title and the modesty it
          preserves.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Manet’s <em>Olympia</em>, on the other hand, does away with this
          veneer. Olympia is not a goddess; she is a recognizable woman,
          specifically, Victorine Meurent, Manet’s favorite model in the 1860s.
          She does not turn away from us that so we may only view her back; she
          faces us full frontal. More than anything though, Olympia looks
          directly at the viewer with no semblance of modesty. Rather, her gaze
          is almost confrontational and as she holds her hand over her genitals,
          the gesture becomes a symbol of control over her own sexuality and
          body. She is completely on display. <em>Olympia</em> was a very
          controversial painting. The name “Olympia” was specific to prostitutes
          at the time. Hervé Lewandowski observes that “the picture portrays the
          cold and prosaic reality of a truly contemporary subject” leading to a
          strong reaction from critics for the “profanation of the idealized
          nude, the very foundation of academic tradition” (Lewandowski).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Eugène Delacroix’s nude falls between these two iconic
          representations of the female nude. His subject is not named after
          Venus and is just a woman. However, she maintains a level of modesty
          found acceptable at the time. She is turned away from us so that we
          only see her back. Her eyes are closed and her body is partially
          covered with a bedsheet. The image is intimate and sensual, and less
          shocking and confrontational. It foreshadows what the female nude will
          develop into. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Paris Salon
          was filled with more and more pictures of female nudes. The nude would
          become something of a craze and following <em>Olympia</em>’s display
          in 1863, it would be parodied by the acclaimed lithographer Honoré
          Daumier in his image{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          (1865).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Even within Delacroix’s oeuvre, <em>Study of a Woman</em> is a
          detour from how the artist visualized the figure of the female nude in
          his other works of art. In his famous painting,{" "}
          <em>Liberty Leading the People</em>, the nude is inspired by countless
          images of classical goddesses. In his <em>Death of Sardanapalus</em>,
          the women twisting and turning are meant to evoke a kind of eroticism,
          while also carrying the dramatic fear and violence of the scene.{" "}
          <em>Study of a Woman</em> is very different in its intimacy and
          quietness. The scene is domestic, calm and quiet. Moreover, the
          technique of etching deployed by the artist allows for surprising
          detail and specificity even in such a small composition. There is a
          heavy contrast between the shadowy room and the clean white sheets of
          the bed. There is also a noticeable difference in texture between the
          thick lines meant to show the creases in the fabric, and the soft
          cross hatching across the woman’s body that draws attention to her
          soft and small curves. Even the size of the etching produces a very
          cozy atmosphere. It also indicates that could the images might have
          been portable, not unlike today’s wallet photos or personalized phone
          backgrounds of loved ones.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-8">
             The idea of female nudity in art is a subject that we are still
          discussing and debating. Controversy arises when art that celebrates
          the female under a male gaze is allowed, but a woman’s celebration of
          her own form is chastised and often censured. The{" "}
          <a href="https://www.mpaa.org/" target="_blank">
            Motion Picture Association of America
          </a>{" "}
          (MPAA) has very subjective ways of rating movies and famously shies
          away from displaying female pleasure on the screen, as seen in{" "}
          <em>This Film is not Yet Rated</em> (2006), a documentary about the
          MPAA’s rating system. The most famous actresses of the day, such as
          Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, and Meryl Streep, among many
          others, all have different opinions on whether presenting oneself
          naked is valid for the sake of art, or simply exploitative and meant
          to grab audience attention. With nudity in film and television
          becoming more prominent and accepted (I can hardly think of a{" "}
          <em>Game of Thrones</em> episode without it), the female nude will
          continue to evolve in tandem with how our views of our own bodies
          change.
