          Naturally, I gravitated towards William Blake’s artwork, specifically
          to the engravings in his <em>Illustrations of the Book of Job</em>{" "}
          (1825), because they demonstrate his ability tell a magnificent story
          and communicate feelings so grand in the space of a single page. Blake
          was born in 1757 and died within a few years of his creating his
          famous engravings for the <em>Book of Job</em>. Blake and his work
          have stood the test of time with various books written about him and
          artworks made to honor his illustrations, especially his piece “When
          the Morning Stars Sang Together” (Plate 14 in his{" "}
          <em>Illustrations of the Book of Job</em>). Blake was a visionary who
          wrote poems and made art all the while revealing his genius as he
          expressed his talent. A radical artist who recreated an important
          story from the Bible, Blake visualized the story of Job in a series of
          imaginative compositions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             As the story goes, Job was a faithful servant of God who tested Job
          by taking away his livestock, his servants, and all of his children.
          As Job was being tested, he started to contemplate the difference
          between life and death, an important theme that runs throughout
          Blake’s engravings. That said, we need to keep in mind that Blake’s
          images for the <em>Book of Job</em> are “essentially works of art, and
          not mere proselytizing diagrams or emblems,” because they carry
          stories along with them (Lister, 595). Each print was carefully
          crafted. Blake did not conform to typical ideals of success and
          believed “that greatest of all blessings (is) a strong imagination”
          (Lister, 595). Being able to see Blake’s masterpieces in the Special
          Collections Research Center and in the SUArt Galleries, is such a
          privilege. For the four years I have attended Syracuse University, I
          never knew we had such hidden gems such as Blake’s{" "}
          <em>Illustrations of the Book of Job</em>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Blake created his illustrations for the <em>Book of Job</em>{" "}
          between 1819 and 1823. The twenty-two brilliant prints began as simple
          illustrations, which were made into “large watercolor drawings for
          Thomas Butts around 1805” (Wimer, 8). Inspired in part by{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/336228"
            target="_blank"
          >
            <em>Melencolia I</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1514) made by Albrecht Dürer, the acclaimed German Renaissance
          artist, Blake’s compositions are similarly packed with powerful visual
          motifs that deftly convey human emotions like misery. Another image by
          Dürer titled,{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/18.65.8/"
            target="_blank"
          >
            <em>The Whore of Babylon, from the Apocalypse</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1498), reminded me of a print in Blake’s <em>Book of Job</em>. Here,
          Dürer grapples with good and evil, just as Blake does in his engraving
          “When the Morning Stars Sang Together,” which I will discuss later on.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Amazingly enough Blake’s plates for the <em>Book of Job</em> are
          “pure engraving” and were “cut with the graver entirely on copper
          without the aid of Aquafortis” a chemical that aids the engraving
          greatly by helping to corrode the metal (Wimer, 8). Every scholarly
          discussion I found about William Blake’s <em>Book of Job</em>{" "}
          emphasized that Blake had faith in himself and his imagination so much
          that he “engraved upon the copper without a previous drawing” (Wimer,
          8-9). The borders and all of the text in the engravings were made in
          dry point needle, which I cannot imagine doing without a previous
          drawing. Blake’s lines were not perfect, but they reveal his unique
          approach to making art.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             The <em>Book of Job</em> was different from Blake’s other projects
          because he was able to fully present his vision in all of its
          brilliance. Blake had finally “achieved effects of delicacy and
          brilliance, of richness and vigor,” all which emerged from the art of
          engraving, but which were extremely difficult to master (Binyon, 7). I
          found the story behind the engravings in the <em>Book of Job</em> to
          be really interesting, especially because some scholars speculate that
          Blake was creating a parallel between Job’s story and the story of his
          own life. Blake viewed Job’s story as “the account of a man’s inward
          struggle and triumph; the conflict between his indwelling Good, and
          Evil, powers” (Binyon, 66). I feel as though this is a narrative about
          what it means to truly be human, to grapple with the idea that we have
          both evil and good inherently within ourselves. There are two main
          themes, the idea that as humans we must walk the path between good and
          evil while at the same time knowing divine justice is at our side.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             A painstaking investment for the enlightened Blake, the{" "}
          <em>Book of Job</em> seems to have been fundamentally centered on the
          idea of faith. According to the Bible, “Job is rewarded for having
          sustained his faith under tribulation,” but Blake put his own spin on
          the story (Vaughan, 66). Blake needed to create a wider understanding
          and bring his imagination to the table, as he always did. Blake added
          to the classic story originally from the Bible that “Job was being
          recompensed because, after tribulation, he now understood the nature
          of faith in a more profound manner” (Vaughan, 66). I love that idea;
          the thought that we must have faith in the very idea of faith itself
          in life to be rewarded. We have to accept life and its many
          possibilities, trusting in our faith and the forces of nature.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             I would now like to focus on Plate 14 in the Illustrations of the{" "}
          <em>Book of Job</em> titled “When the Morning Stars Sang Together,”
          the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.themorgan.org/collection/drawings/84883"
            target="_blank"
          >
            original drawing
          </a>{" "}
          for which resides in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City. A
          beautiful composition with dramatic contrasts in light and shadow, the
          image depicts angel-like figures singing, their hands raised, and
          their figures bathed in light. This illustration comes after the scene
          in which Job asked God to appear and explain why he deserved all the
          evils that ruined him. Here, God, whose figure dominates the
          composition, reenacts creating the world, while Job and his wife and
          other worshippers kneel below. Here, we also see all of the elements
          that were previously banished from Job’s life, being restored, many of
          which are found in the border. Light and land are restored, as well as
          the light Job has been missing together with all of the animals that
          he had lost. The morning stars are depicted amongst twinkling stars;
          however, they take the form of angels who grace the top of the
          illustration. The mystic in Blake emerges in this piece, with the
          cosmos intertwining with nature. Along the border to the right we see
          the words, “And God made two great lights,” with images of the moon
          and sun. Job represents a test of life and faith, a trial which will
          ultimately result in greater mindfulness (Vaughan, 67).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Additionally, there are details like the crescent crowned woman
          (Selene, goddess of the moon) in control of two vicious looking snakes
          who can be seen beneath God, under his wingspan to the right within
          the image, and across from her is Helios, the sun god, shown with four
          white horses. These figures with their accompanying symbols are
          inserted to enlighten the viewer about Job’s newfound knowledge of
          life. I find it beautiful yet haunting to see the snakes opposite the
          horses, because white horses can symbolize death (by acting as the
          free spirit that can be corrupted by evil and darkness) in
          Christianity while snakes symbolize the continuation and renewal of
          life. Not only does Job grapple with life and death in the same image,
          he gives us a complex image that focuses on the inner workings of good
          and evil.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Blake’s engravings for the <em>Book of Job</em> are strongly linked
          to Romanticism, rousing our emotions and making us question our
          understanding of time, space, and our place among it all. Blake was a
          spiritual person and exemplified a Romantic who was far ahead of his
          time. Referring to the <em>Book of Job</em>, John Ruskin remarked that
          Blake was “among ‘the highest…in certain characters of imagination and
          expression” with an excellent “mode of obtaining certain effects of
          light,” and went so far as to say that in terms of “expressing
          conditions of glaring and flickering light, Blake is greater than
          Rembrandt” (Wimer, 8-9). This was high praise indeed. Ruskin was
          right. Blake was a revolutionary for his time. He was timeless then as
          he is now.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Blake has become one of my biggest inspirations because he followed
          his own spirit and marched to his own beat, without looking back or
          questioning the trust he placed in himself. As an artist, I struggle
          to trust myself while grappling with my understanding of what success
          looks like in a world full of talent. Blake has taught me, as he
          taught so many throughout time, to follow my own imagination and never
          to stifle the guiding light within my spirit, which will shine forever
          if I let it.

             Today, in our current society, those who stand out are celebrated
          and paid attention to. We admire the vision and eternal spirit that
          William Blake had; he was one in a million. In Blake’s own words,
          “time may rage, but rage in vain,” for his extraordinary corpus of
          work would outlast time, his “designs” would “unchanged remain”
          (Butterworth, 6). Blake’s engravings were one of a kind, and his
          attitude towards life has inspired me in many ways. I think most of
          all, William Blake has inspired me to trust myself more than my peers,
          my fears, or my society because if you put your soul into your artwork
          then you will live forever.
