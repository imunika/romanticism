          Augustus Pugin was a British architect in the nineteenth century and
          was recognized as an influential force in the revival of Gothic
          architecture in England (Stanton, 10). Though there was a renewed
          interest in the Gothic, not everybody shared Pugin’s passion for the
          Gothic style (Vaughan, 100). Pugin collaborated with architect and
          antiquarian Edwards James Willson to compile a series of plates of
          Gothic “specimens” of English architecture to “represent the
          geometrical proportions, plans, and construction of genuine examples
          of the Architecture of the middle ages” (Pugin and Willson, vol. 1,
          5). The result was Specimens of Gothic Architecture: Selected from
          Various Ancient Edifices in England: Consisting of Plans, Elevations,
          Sections, and Parts at Large (1825), a book that contains historical
          and descriptive accounts of various examples of Gothic architecture
          accompanied by corresponding plates. The historical and descriptive
          accounts go into detail about the basic characteristics as well as the
          functions of the featured edifices. Pugin and Willson hoped that
          people would use this book as a reference to study examples of pure
          Gothic architecture (Pugin and Willson, vol. 1, 5). A copy of the book
          is housed in the Special Collections Research Center at Syracuse
          University.

          The plate seen here was retrieved from volume two of Pugin and
          Willson’s Specimens of Gothic Architecture (pl. xlvi). It displays a
          turret and gable found in the chapel at King’s College at the
          University of Cambridge. Construction of the chapel was commissioned
          by King Henry VI in 1446 and was split up into three distinct phases
          (Pennick, 30). The turret and gable shown in the plate are only a
          handful of architectural elements in the chapel, but they embody the
          Gothic style that Pugin and Willson hoped to represent in their
          voluminous study. Moreover, they have been detached from the chapel
          and enlarged to show their intricate detail and ornament. A turret is
          a small tower, used for ornament or to increase the strength of a
          building (Parker, 310). A gable is the upper wall of the end of a
          building, where the top conforms to the slopes of the roof (Parker,
          126). Shown in this plate is the “upper part of one of the four lofty
          turrets which adorn its angles; with a portion of the adjoining gable”
          (Pugin and Willson,vol. 2, 29). The turret and adjoining gable are
          accompanied by a plan from the lower part of the elevation, labeled
          Plan at A (Pugin and Willson, vol. 2, 29). The turret is then even
          further fragmented and a corner of the plan is enlarged and labeled B
          (Pugin and Willson, vol. 2, 29). The cross that lays upon the crest of
          the gable is also magnified and is labeled C (Pugin and Willson, vol.
          2, 29). In the accompanying reading to the plate, Pugin describes the
          process through which the turret is placed upon the gable. “The
          turrets are carried up without any ornament as high as the battlements
          of the roof, above which they are beautifully decorates, as shown in
          the plate” (Pugin and Willson, vol. 2, 29).

          Specimens of Gothic Architecture is an elaborate record of Gothic
          buildings in England. It appears that Pugin and Willson wanted to
          popularize the style of Gothic architecture and make it accessible to
          the general public by carefully documenting medieval edifices. But
          what was novel is that they did not document entire buildings,
          selecting instead key Gothic features. Architectural elements were
          extracted from their structures and contexts, drawing attention to
          each element’s essential characteristics. In doing so, each Gothic
          feature emerged as its own entity, its function and importance
          accentuated in the process. By clearly stating the purpose of each
          “specimen,” Pugin and Willson emphasized Gothic architecture as
          logical and functional (Vaughan, 130). Such an approach mirrored
          Pugin’s belief that architecture should be governed by utility and
          function, and that ornament should enhance and not obscure (Vaughan,
          130). By compiling this dense and extraordinary record as a reference
          for future architects, Pugin and Willson hoped to prevent any blunders
          in designing modern Gothic edifices in which Gothic principles might
          be disregarded (Pugin and Willson, vol. 1, 5). They “hoped and
          believed that every form and member here represented can easily be
          executed” (Pugin and Willson, vol. 1, 5).

          Pugin was an expert on Gothic architecture and he “considered it to be
          the only truly style of Christian architecture” (Hyland, 236). A
          convert to Catholicism in 1835, Pugin’s life was heavily influenced by
          his religious beliefs. His devotion to Catholicism is evident from his
          belief that incorporating classical Greek styles in churches was a sin
          (Vaughan, 129). He also was known to wear medieval clothing around his
          home (Vaughan, 129). Pugin believed that “integrity and propriety were
          to be found only in the Gothic architecture that was produced in what
          he believed had been a more moral age – an age when life was regulated
          by Christian principles” (Hyland, 236). During the medieval ages,
          churches were adorned to reflect Christian principles, and as a result
          these churches “were not simply buildings in which, but rather with
          which one might worship god” (Hyland, 235). Pugin regarded Gothic
          architecture as uniting earth and heaven in the same way that William
          Blake’s Angels Watching Over the Body of Christ in the Sepulchre
          (1805) united the two realms (Hyland, 236). Blake, like Pugin, was
          interested in the spirituality of the Gothic and his medieval works
          took the form of Christian subjects (Vaughan, 101). This etching by
          Blake depicts two angels hovering over the body of Christ, their wings
          uniting to form an arch – a popular characteristic of the Gothic
          style. The origins of the arch can be thought to have derived from the
          natural forces of two adjacent trees interlocking (Vaughan, 122).

        <p className="indent-8">
          Pugin’s views on Gothic architecture align with ideas of the Medieval
          Revival in England, which drew attention to the grandeur and splendor
          of the English Gothic (Vaughan, 100). According to Pugin and Willson,
          Gothic architecture was “acknowledged throughout the principal
          countries of Europe, as the most beautiful and convenient style of
          building…with edifices of such lightness and sublimity of effect as
          the world has never before witnessed” (Pugin and Willson, vol. 1, 5).
          There was an interest in the Gothic for its evocative quality. For
          artists, it became associated with everything unsettling (Vaughan,
          100). Pugin and Willson describe the decorations of the turret and
          gable as “bold and decisive, producing a clear and distinct effect,
          even at the great height they are placed” (Pugin and Willson, vol. 2,
          29). Their use of the word “effect” in their description implies that
          these edifices evoked an emotion or a sensation. The planning of
          King’s College Chapel relied heavily on sacred measurements or
          proportions recorded in scriptural accounts as was common in medieval
          architecture (Pennick, 26). These dimensions defined the chapel as a
          sacred vessel (Pennick, 27). Such an approach to architecture can also
          be seen as aligned with the Romantic idea that the Gothic was not just
          a style but an atmosphere (Vaughan, 100).

        <p className="indent-8">
          All the plates in Specimens of Gothic Architecture are the most basic
          depictions of medieval edifices. There is a heavy emphasis on line
          without the excess of elements such as how light and shadow might
          affect the buildings. In Romanticism, the line itself was regarded as
          a key artistic feature that was capable of evoking emotion, which in
          turn created atmosphere (Vaughan, 16). Outline was the visual method
          that came closest to the allusive quality of poetry, and line was
          thought to coax the imagination to fill in the gaps (Vaughan, 16).
          Line could also be seen as inspired by a medieval aesthetic, as
          demonstrated in John Flaxman’s Penelope’s Dream (1805). Flaxman
          grasped the essence of form of the figures in this outline drawing, in
          the same way that Pugin and Willson would in their architectural
          plates (Vaughan, 16). By depicting medieval edifices on paper in their
          most basic form, Pugin and Willson enabled their forms to be easily
          replicated by anyone interested in reproducing Gothic architecture.

        <p className="indent-8">
          Pugin and Willson’s study of Gothic architecture is based on empirical
          observation, which Pugin delivers through his comprehensive scrutiny
          of selected edifices. Empirical observation was popular in the
          Romantic era as it focused on learning from nature. By recording
          architectural details like scientific specimens, Pugin and Willson
          preserved their knowledge of medieval architecture, while also
          presenting the vastness and diversity of Gothic architecture in one
          convenient source. “No previous publications having presented so many
          details of mouldings and ornaments adapted to actual practice” (Pugin
          and Willson, vol. 1, 5). Indeed, Pugin and Willson’s presentation of
          architectural detail can be compared to how botanists and zoologists
          depict their specimens against blank backgrounds. In the same way that
          scientists separate animals and plants from their natural habitats to
          represent them on paper, Pugin and Willson separated architectural
          details from buildings to reproduce them in their book. Pugin and
          Willson’s observations would become important sources for future
          Gothic replicas.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-8">
          Today, Pugin and Willson’s extensive documentation of Gothic
          architecture can be compared to the growing field of digital
          architecture in 3D. Specimens of Gothic Architecture and digital
          architecture share the same goal to preserve and educate people about
          the built environment, past and present. Digitizing historical
          architecture is a growing trend in international preservation
          initiatives. Virtual environments are created that can be retrieved
          from anywhere and by anybody. The digitizing of historical
          architecture is a more modern version of what Pugin and Willson
          accomplished with Specimens of Gothic Architecture. In the same way
          that being able to access historical architecture online may seem
          novel and exciting to us, being able to retrieve different examples of
          Gothic edifices in a single voluminous study probably seemed as novel
          in the nineteenth century.
