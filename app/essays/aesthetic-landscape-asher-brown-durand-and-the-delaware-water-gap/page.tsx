             The American tradition of depicting natural landscapes in art
          blossomed during the early nineteenth century, pivoting away from the
          European tradition of capturing nature in conjunction with
          architectural remains of the past exemplified by such images as
          William Gilpin’s aquatint of Wilton Castle in the fifth edition of{" "}
          <em>Observations on the River Wye</em> (1789). In sharp contrast to
          their European colleagues, American artists chose to portray idealized
          views of the seemingly untouched-by-man beauty of their surroundings.
          As part of a collaboration with his friend, the acclaimed American

             Born in northwest New Jersey, artist Asher Brown Durand first
          worked for his father, a watchmaker and silversmith, observing the
          techniques of working with metals and engravings before apprenticing
          with an engraver at the age of eighteen (Avery). In the early stages
          of his career, Durand made small engravings and engravings based on
          other artists’ paintings. Later, he transitioned into a period of
          painting portraits and genre scenes, during which he became acquainted
          with Bryant and{" "}

        <p className="indent-8">
             While Bryant provided the romantic prose and poetic visions of
          landscapes that inspired contemplation and meditation, Durand composed
          the emotionally stimulating images of North American landscapes that
          would appeal to readers and viewers. For example,{" "}
          <em>Delaware Water Gap</em> (1830) has a fallen log in the center of
          the composition, a representation of the end of one life and the
          beginning of another. Or perhaps the image is simply the
          representation of nature decaying and becoming one with itself. Like
          the woodcut illustrations in the books that fascinated Durand when he
          was a boy, this engraving reveals the artist’s interest in the
          wildlife surrounding the Delaware River and emphasizes the serpentine
          curves of the river itself (Craven, 52). Durand focuses specifically
          on the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nps.gov/dewa/index.htm" target="_blank">
            Delaware Water Gap
          </a>
          , the quarter-mile wide, low-lying river gap that hugs the New
          Jersey-Pennsylvania stretch of the Delaware River. The result of land
          being carved out by retreating glaciers, runoff water flowing from the
          Appalachian to the Pocono Mountains, and abrasive minerals flowing and
          settling along the river path, the Delaware Water Gap that flows
          through Kittatinny Ridge is a formation of rough mountain ridges and
          low-lying forested mountain area.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             In Durand’s composition, we see, framed between two birch trees, a
          river between two mountains winding its way from behind the opposite
          shore to around the bend of the bank of the slanted fallen birch. The
          sky dominates the composition. Storm clouds approach from the right
          side of the composition, slowly threatening to cross over the river
          and empty their contents below. While these surging cloud formations
          echo the lines of the bent tree branches of the slanted birch, so do
          the gestures of the figures in the foreground parallel the slant of
          the river bank. A mother appears to call out to her son while a man
          gestures towards the approaching boat further upstream. A fourth
          individual tugs at a boat to bring it ashore.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             From the time of exploration and settlement by Europeans in the
          sixteenth century, the land of North America had been seen by
          Europeans and other countries as a land of new possibilities, new
          hopes, new beginnings. It sparked the imagination of foreigners and
          its serene landscapes impressed visitors, be it in the sandy beaches
          of the east coast, or the rocky trails and winding rivers of the
          Appalachian Mountains, or the sprawling green plains of the Midwest.
          Seen within this context, the roots of the birch tree in the
          foreground of the engraving can be read as a visual metaphor for
          striking roots in a new country and establishing new colonies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             The turn of the nineteenth century brought a wave of European
          immigrants to the newly formed nation with thousands of these
          individuals moving west past the major east coast cities and settling
          in newly explored rural areas. While the settlers shown in{" "}
          <em>Delaware Water Gap</em> were outsiders who had to start anew and
          who would probably build villages, towns, and perhaps even cities in
          the area, by contrast, a lone Native American figure gazes into the
          mist of the waterfall in Durand’s earlier engraving{" "}
          <em>Falls of the Sawkill</em> (1830), a composition in which the
          artist draws attention to how humankind could inhabit nature without
          depleting its beauty and resources (Craven, 52). Indigenous peoples
          had been living throughout North America for centuries prior to
          European exploration, living off the land and its natural resources by
          using all of what they had, not wasting a thing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             As the Industrial Revolution took hold in North America, Durand and
          other American artists became worried about the urbanization of
          natural landscapes. The seemingly untouched landscape in{" "}
          <em>Delaware Water Gap</em> accentuates the artist’s interest in
          keeping the landscape as natural as possible. Yet his composition also
          hints at how settlers would begin changing the landscapes of the
          Delaware river. Although nature shown here appears to be a sanctuary
          of beauty and harmony that should be left as untouched and picturesque
          as possible, the arriving settlers suggest that the landscape is
          poised on the brink of change.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             While his engraving skills revealed the hand of a master artist, by
          the 1830s, when he completed the <em>Delaware Water Gap</em> (1830),
          Durand looked to explore his talent in painting, specifically in
          portraiture, genre scenes, and landscape painting. These works, which
          often incorporated the Romantic motif of nature and landscapes, were
          not so much influenced by the works of his contemporaries in America
          (or even Europe) but rather by his studies of 17th- and 18th-century
          European paintings (Avery). His landscape paintings often focused on
          the rivers and grand mountains of the Hudson River Valley, but with
          the careful use of light to best portray a dreamlike aesthetic of the
          untouched wilderness.

          ), Durand was considered to be a great American landscape painter who
          focused on the natural beauty that was distinctly North American.
          Actively involved with the Hudson River School, Cole, Durand Church,
          and Doughty focused on the natural and spiritual properties of the
          landscapes of the Hudson River Valley area.

             Today, the idea of untouched natural environments can be seen
          across the United States thanks in part to the creation of the{" "}

            National Park Service
          </a>
          , while major natural landmarks and formations across the globe are
          protected by national groups and acts, such as{" "}
          <a href="https://en.unesco.org/" target="_blank">
            UNESCO

          and the{" "}

            National Environmental Policy Act
          </a>
          . Roaring rivers, colossal Redwoods, sand-duned deserts—are all
          protected in part thanks to the Romantics who understood the
          importance of nature and paid heed to their emotional connections to
          their natural surroundings.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             While the engraving made nearly two hundred years ago is a visual
          representation of a landscape that has since changed, it serves as a
          visual reminder of humankind’s indelible impact on natural landscapes
          and on the natural resources that flourished prior to human
          habitation. Forests that use to stand tall and mighty now lie in paper
          boxes, in preparation to be used for the next printing round of exams.
          Rivers that use to run clear with fish and birds are now polluted from
          factory runoffs. Clear skies that use to display a show of shooting
          stars, constellations, and planets are now a hazy mass thanks to the
          growing presence of artificial light. Resources, which had been used
          in moderation and consideration a few centuries ago, are now
          diminished because of corporate greed and lack of public awareness.
          Durand’s <em>Delaware Water Gap</em> is a testament to the beauty of
          nature, the purity of its rivers and freshness of crisp air, a place
          for retreat and contemplation.
