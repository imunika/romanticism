            John James Audubon
          </a>{" "}
          lived most of his life watching birds fly freely among humans and was
          fascinated by their diverse beauty and personalities. Born in Les
          Cayes in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now known as Haiti), and
          brought up in France, Audubon moved to America during the start of the
          Napoleonic wars. In America, a vast and great wilderness gave him
          multiple opportunities to study fascinating birds of more variety than
          he had ever seen before. As he set out to draw and study every bird he
          came across in his new adopted country, he paid as close attention as
          possible to the actual size and color of the birds he encountered.
          This devotion to accuracy would set the tone for his publication, the
          famous <i>The Birds of America</i> (1827-1838). After many years of
          recording American birds and armed with over 400 life-size bird
          drawings, Audubon set out to England in search of an engraver and
          publisher. After a few exhibitions of his work, he became famous and
          many wealthy customers, including king George IV himself, sought to
          purchase his hand-painted plates. Today John James Audubon is still
          renowned for his contributions to scientific and ornithological
          research as well as to the art world.

          While Audubon shot his birds and often created specimens of them, he
          also spent a lot of time observing them. He would observe the bird’s
          movements, behavior, social patterns, diet and more, to produce a
          comprehensive and credible image of the bird. On his “double elephant
          folio” paper (39.5 x 26.5 inches), Audubon would develop life-size,
          elaborate drawings of American bird species. In each of his images,
          every bird had a personality of its own. At the time, most
          ornithological drawings were based on the dead forms of specimens that
          were created in advance, resulting in very flat images (such as
          Alexander Wilson’s renderings) —but Audubon went above and beyond the
          typical specimen drawing. In his images, there was always a story and
          a sense of action or suspense expressed through the bird’s movements.
          The viewer could feel the birds as if they were alive in their natural
          habitats, a far cry from the stiff, lifeless forms that were otherwise
          drawn and printed on blank pages. Moreover, Audubon would often
          include elaborate vegetation and landscapes in his compositions,
          thereby giving his viewers a sense of the vast American wilderness
          that these creatures inhabited.

        <p className="indent-8">
          Audubon’s prints were not ordinary ornithological specimen recordings;
          they were something never done or seen before. They combined Audubon’s
          knowledge of science and his artistic skills, thus bringing to life on
          paper exquisite representations of fantastic American creatures. Each
          bird was accurately rendered down to its every last detail. Sometimes
          Audubon would even distort his birds to make them more visually alive
          and interesting. Audubon’s ground-breaking approach to representing
          birds is what qualifies him as an artist working in the era of
          Romanticism. Let us now turn to the{" "}

          in America. How might we characterize this image as one that fits into
          the broader scope of Romanticism?

        <p className="indent-8">
          Drawn by Audubon and engraved and hand-colored in 1833 by the
          printmaker Robert Havell, Audubon’s American Crow is shown perched on
          a walnut tree branch above the delicate nest of a ruby throated
          hummingbird. The dark form of the bird contrasts sharply with the rest
          of the print. Its head is gracefully turned to look at us as if we
          have caught him in the act of stealing the hummingbird’s eggs. One of
          its legs is elegantly stretched out for the viewer to see as if the
          crow were about to take a step up to get a better look at the eggs.
          Carefully rendered, its claws accurately drawn, the crow is shown in
          all its glory, its feathers iridescent in the light with highlights of
          purples, reds and blues, its glistening eye animating its expression.
          Audubon chose to leave the background white rather than add any hint
          of landscape. The white background helps to isolate the bird as our
          focal point, drawing attention to the bird as a specimen. It also
          contrasts beautifully with the crow’s black body.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Audubon’s composition leaves the viewer guessing as to what might
          happen next, which most likely ends with the crow quickly snatching
          the delicate hummingbird eggs. This kind of storytelling strategy is
          very common in Audubon’s prints such as the one depicting a golden
          eagle taking off with a rabbit in its talons or the image portraying a
          group of ivory-billed woodpeckers discovering a bug on a dead tree.
          What is interesting about the American Crow is that the viewer feels
          like one is a part of the picture space. The crow interacts with us as
          if we have stumbled upon it right before it was about to steal the
          eggs. It seems to have turned around to notice us watching. This kind
          of intimate view probably stemmed from Audubon’s personal experiences
          with crows. In his writings, Audubon observes that the crow was very
          cautious of his surroundings and stealthy in its actions. American
          Crow captures the shy yet cunning personality of the crow who in turn
          appears to observe us as it plans to snatch the eggs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          The crow can also be considered one of the most detested birds in
          America. Often viewed negatively as the thief of birds that ruins
          crops, dwells in graveyards, and signals bad luck, death and more, the
          crow rarely evokes any positive associations. But Audubon was one of
          the few who saw a remarkable beauty in the creature, which is evident
          in his print and also in his writings. Audubon does not shy away from
          depicting the cunning personality of the bird as it stalks the
          precious eggs; instead, he accentuates this trait as a sign of
          superior intelligence among birds. It is the crow’s intelligence that
          enables it to feed itself and others. Indeed, the crow is known as a
          scavenger that annoys various birds and animals around it as it
          attempts to sneak off with one of their prey. Moreover, the crow and
          its flock will often eat large amounts of corn grown by the farmer in
          his field. Despite these actions that have given the crow its bad
          reputation, we often overlook the good that the crow does for us and
          the ecosystem as well. As Audubon observed, the “crow devours myriads
          of grubs every day of the year, that might lay waste the farmer’s
          fields; it destroys quadrupeds innumerable, every one of which is an
          enemy to his poultry and his flocks. Why then should the farmer be so
          ungrateful, when he sees such services rendered to him by a
          providential friend, as to persecute that friend even to the death?”
          (Audubon, 88). While the crow might eat the farmer’s corn, it also
          inadvertently helps the farmer by eating harmful insects and driving
          away or killing harmful animals. The crow “plunders the fields of
          their superabundance, and is blamed for so doing, but it is seldom
          praised when it chases the thieving Hawk from the poultry-yard”
          (Audubon, 88). Audubon tells us that crows are much more beautiful
          creatures than what meets the eye.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          The crow is a very social animal that forms flocks in the hundreds or
          even thousands. Yet it is depicted as a solitary creature in Audubon’s
          print. In fact, in most of Audubon’s prints, birds like crows that are
          commonly found in a flock, are placed among others of their species or
          at least with a male/ female counterpart. But the crow is shown
          independently and humbly on its own. This gives the crow the grandeur
          we find in Audubon’s renderings of larger, more powerful birds such as
          the Golden Eagle or the Great Blue Heron who are also shown alone.
          Additionally, Audubon’s composition of the crow observing us
          emphasizes the bird’s intelligence; the crow appears more thoughtful
          in a way that coaxes us, the viewer, to relate our own emotions to the
          crow. Interestingly, the crow is situated on a black walnut tree which
          is one of the scarcest and most commercially valuable trees in the
          eastern hardwood forest. Such a visual juxtaposition further
          demonstrates the value Audubon sees in the elegant, powerful, and
          intelligent American crow.

        <p className="indent-8">
          Audubon saw something special in every animal around him and drew
          attention to the need to respect and protect them and their habitats.
          Today, we see more and more birds fall victim to our destructive ways
          of life. Pollution, hunting, technology, and industrial agriculture
          threaten every aspect of animal life and the natural environment that
          animals inhabit. While many individuals are unaware of the
          consequences their actions have on animals and nature, Audubon thought
          the least we could is try to respect them and become less selfish
          about their existence: “every individual in the land is aware of the
          superabundance of food that exists among us, and of which a portion
          may well be spared for the feathered beings, that tend to enhance our
          pleasures by the sweetness of their song, the innocence of their
          lives, or their curious habits.” (Audubon, 88). The{" "}
