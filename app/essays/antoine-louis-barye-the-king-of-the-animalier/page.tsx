          was named “Michelangelo of the menagerie” by art critic Théophile
          Gautier who was impressed by Barye’s{" "}

          in Paris. The French artist was acclaimed for his mastery of the{" "}
          <em>animalier</em> tradition, influencing both his contemporaries such
          as the illustrious Eugène Delacroix, as well as successive generations
          of artists. Admired chiefly for his bronze creatures, Barye’s prolific
          body of work included skillfully rendered portraits, landscape, and
          animal paintings. Embracing distinctive elements of Romanticism, Barye
          explored the emotive power of nature and the Sublime. <em>Tiger</em>,
          Barye’s plaster mold in the art collections at Syracuse University, is
          one of the countless animated sculptures of animals that the artist
          made in the nineteenth century.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-8">
             <em>Tiger</em> exemplifies Barye’s preoccupation with nature and
          the exotic–a fascination he shared with many other Romantics. During
          an age of colonization and expansive empirical study, a wide-ranging
          curiosity regarding the natural world and zoology emerged and
          flourished. The fluid connections between the arts, humanities, and
          sciences encouraged artists to explore the world through multiple
          lenses. Additionally, the importation of foreign animals triggered an
          intense interest in their unfamiliarity. A taste for exotic animals
          prevailed in all visual domains. The circus and animal combat became
          spectacles of public attraction. Barye frequented these events along
          with menageries, museums, and animal dissections to draw and sketch
          his subjects (Johnston, 5). Moreover, like many other Romantics, he
          practiced “plein air” painting (painting in nature), which enabled him
          to encounter animals in their outdoor habitats. By 1793, the Jardin
          des Plantes was instituted in Paris and a small zoo established within
          its precincts became a significant focal point of Barye’s research
          (Johnston, 5; 33-34). The Cabinet of Comparative Anatomy accompanied
          the menagerie allowing for close proximity to the foreign animals that
          drew his attention. The artist exhaustively studied the behavior of
          captive animals at the Jardin des Plantes. For its part, the Cabinet
          of Comparative Anatomy showcased skeletons and dissections, which
          provided anatomical measurements that Barye replicated in his
          sculptures (Johnston, 5-6). Often accompanied by Delacroix, Barye also
          visited the menagerie in Saint-Cloud where both artists indulged in
          their passion for observing wild and exotic animals (Johnston, 6).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Barye’s meticulous depiction of animal character is attributed to
          his keen eye for exploration and his extensive documentation of
          scientific knowledge. As seen in <em>Tiger</em>, Barye deftly renders
          the muscular anatomy and savage intensity of the creature. Sculpted in
          the Romantic tradition of the “momentary,” the tiger is depicted in
          the midst of a powerful stride, its jaw opened slightly. Small yet
          powerful, it makes the viewer anticipate its next move. We are in awe
          of the beast as we simultaneously admire its natural simplicity and
          spontaneity. Barye skillfully retains a detailed and lively
          duplication of the animal, despite the work’s compact scale.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             The nineteenth-century sculpture characterizes Barye’s{" "}
          <em>animalier</em> pieces in addition to suggesting the urban
          domestication of wildlife. Without unified validation from the critics
          of the Paris Salon early on in his career, Barye lacked the requisite
          endorsement from the State to produce bronze statues on a monumental
          scale. In order to supplement his income, therefore, he accepted
          private commissions from members of the aristocracy and bourgeoisie
          (Johnston, x-xi; 66-72). Barye primarily produced portable bronze
          statues that echoed the scale of <em>Tiger</em>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Formally educated and highly proficient in the art of sculpting,
          the artist utilized various forms of casting, often first producing
          plaster models like the <em>Tiger</em> that would later be remade in
          bronze. <em>Tiger</em> also demonstrates the desire to reproduce the
          ferocious predator in a minimized size. By diminishing the scale,
          Barye effectively subdues the vicious animal, further suggesting that
          it is subject to human ownership. In other words, the artist harnessed
          untamed ferocity in a decorative size for aesthetic pleasure. Indeed,
          Barye’s prominence arose from his ability to blur the line between
          fine art and decorative sculpture. Seen another way, the desire to
          “capture” the animal in bronze mirrors the need to make captive
          wildlife—all for human amusement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Across Antoine-Louis Barye’s vast body of work,{" "}
          <em>Jaguar Devouring a Hare</em> (1850) is one of the artist’s most
          admired sculptures. Presiding currently in the Walters Art Museum in
          Baltimore, this striking work of art features the elongated muscular
          body of a jaguar ravaging a hare’s feeble corpse. Following the
          artist’s absence from the Paris Salon,{" "}
          <em>Jaguar Devouring a Hare</em> marked his second debut. Commissioned
          by the State, Barye proclaimed his talent with the frenzied scene
          masterfully compacted and cast in bronze (Johnston, 10; Johnston and
          Kelly, 166). When the sculpture was exhibited at the Exposition
          Universelle of 1855, critics raved about Barye’s impassioned
          naturalism. Gautier applauded the artist’s statue, observing that “the
          mere reproduction of nature does not constitute art; he aggrandizes
          his animal subjects, simplifying them, idealizing and styling them in
          a manner that is bold, energetic, and rugged,” (Gautier, 1856; as
          cited by Johnston, 166). Similarly, the Goncourt brothers, Edmond and
          Jules, appraised the work with their review of the Salon of 1852 in
          stating, “contemporary art… has as its basis the displacement of… its
          focus on the heroic past, in favor of a direct engagement with
          nature,”. They continued in acknowledging Barye’s novelty with, “this
          displacement… is nothing arbitrary, but represents the necessary
          ‘evolution’ of modern art,” (Simms, 71).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             As I noted earlier, Gautier had dubbed Barye the “Michelangelo of
          the menagerie,” a distinction that other critics and academics of the
          time continually referenced. The qualities that they praised in the{" "}
          <em>Jaguar Devouring a Hare</em> could in fact be found throughout the
          artist’s portfolio. The jaguar’s pose and detail are similar to what
          we see in <em>Tiger</em> and both sculptures emphasize the artist’s
          extensive research on animal behavior and anatomy. Moreover, both
          felines are depicted as stealthy, agile, and powerful creatures whose
          movements heighten our sense of anticipation. While the jaguar
          fiercely gnaws on its prey, the tiger proudly stalks its prey, its
          mouth seemingly open as if about to emit a roar. The ferocious action
          in combination with the pronounced tension of the body reiterates the
          allure of savage wildlife. Barye, again, selects an exotic feline as
          the focal point of his work, thus highlighting a preoccupation with
          the unfamiliar.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             In later years, <em>Jaguar Devouring a Hare</em> would also inspire
          other celebrated artists. Emerging during the Post-Impressionist
          period, French artist Henri Matisse imitated Barye in his{" "}
          <a href="https://frenchsculpture.org/en/sculpture/7030-jaguar-devouring-a-hare-copy-after-baryes">
            early sculptural work
          </a>{" "}
          (Millard, 238-239). Made between 1899 and 1901, Matisse’s model
          reveals the direct influence of Barye’s sculpture (Johnston and Kelly,
          166). Matisse’s study shares the emotive quality of Barye’s work, yet
          it also presents the jagged geometric-like carving reminiscent of
          Matisse’s cubist style as opposed to Barye’s organic realism.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             During his period of absence from the Paris Salon, Barye directed
          his skills towards commercial profit. With little documentation left
          behind by the artist, art historians have concluded the establishment
          of multiple workshops during this time (Johnston, 66-72). Yet
          ultimately, Barye promoted his small-scale bronze statues through
          various foundries, few under his own operation. Following the artist’s
          death in 1940, Ferdinand Barbedienne is notably credited with
          purchasing and replicating 126 Barye bronzes (Kader, 151).{" "}
          <a href="https://art.thewalters.org/detail/6495/walking-tiger/">
            <em>Walking Tiger (Striding Tiger)</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1844) was one such example that was issued in the catalogue of beasts
          to be made by the Barbedienne foundry (Johnston, 157). Roger Ballu,
          one of the artist’s first biographers, determined that the piece was
          intended to complement{" "}
          <em>
            <a href="https://art.thewalters.org/detail/37701/lion-walking/">
              Lion Walking
            </a>
          </em>{" "}
          from 1836 (Ballu, 1890; as cited by Johnston, 157). Both{" "}
          <em>Walking Tiger (Striding Tiger)</em> and <em>Lion Walking</em>{" "}
          (figure 5) bear a striking resemblance to <em>Tiger</em>.
          Specifically, the plaster model suggests the artist was making
          preliminary studies for his later work,{" "}
          <em>Walking Tiger (Striding Tiger)</em>. As witnessed with earlier
          works, foundries, such as Honoré Gonon and Sons, cast molds of Barye’s
          models. The molds “allowed for the creation of cast-plaster positives…
          the technique insured that the original sculptor’s model would not be
          lost in event of a bad [lost-wax bronze] pour,” (Benge, 233).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Each work precisely imitates the muscular anatomy of the animals, a
          detailed approach that characterizes the artist’s entire body of work.
          But <em>Walking Tiger (Striding Tiger)</em> does something more—it is
          a striking duplicate of the plaster mold, be it in the creature’s
          stance or in its alert scowl. Besides such similarities, the
          dimensions of each work are also remarkably close. <em>Tiger</em>{" "}
          measures nine inches high, sixteen inches long, while{" "}
          <em>Walking Tiger</em> is a little over 8 inches by 16 inches.
          Clearly, Barye’s <em>Tiger</em> in the art collections at Syracuse
          University is a rare early model for <em>Walking Tiger</em>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Barye’s <em>Tiger</em> highlights the Romantic fascination with
          nature as a spectacle and with exoticism at large—a fascination that
          remains embedded in modern culture today. The Romantic movement
          sparked a taste for spontaneity and naturalism. As the leading{" "}
          <em>animalier</em> of his time, Antoine-Louis Barye championed such
          taste by focusing on the spontaneous and primal energy of exotic
          beasts. As I have discussed earlier, Barye pioneered the art of
          transforming exotic animals into domestic ornaments. Utilizing
          sand-casting rather than lost-wax casting, the artist made affordable
          masterpieces for both the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie (Johnston,
          66-72). Owning one of Barye’s statues meant possessing the power and
          luxury associated with these animals. The primal feline boasts a
          regality and vigorous spirit that is continually idolized in our
          culture today. Media and popular culture reiterate the status and
          power associated with exoticism. Till this day, celebrities invest in
          exotic “pets.” Affluent rappers, known for parading their wealth,
          often purchase foreign animals to draw attention to themselves.
          Notably, Rick Ross and Tyga flashed their ownership of tigers across
          media platforms. With the endangerment of the species, desire for
          their rarity amplified the animal as a recognizable symbol of power.
          Essentially, Barye’s sculpture popularized the taste for animal
          subjects across fine and decorative arts—a taste that continues to be
          fostered in the modern era.
