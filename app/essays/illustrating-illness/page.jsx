            Francisco de Goya
          </a>{" "}
          is an acclaimed Spanish artist who is identified with the Romantic
          movement, and his etching titled{" "}
          <em>De que mal morira? (Of what will he die?)</em> is no exception to
          this. Between 1797-1799, Goya worked on this print, along with 79
          other etchings, as a part of his series <em>Los Caprichos</em>. This
          was around the time that he began experiencing a variety of health
          issues, including deafness, which had a significant impact on his
          artistic pursuits. While Goya is often cited as a prominent figure in
          Romantic art, his series <em>Los Caprichos</em> can be used to both
          support and oppose this claim, and this becomes apparent when looking
          at how Goya combined Romantic elements with his own unique stylistic
          choices that did not necessarily align with typical Romantic values.
          In <em>De que mal morira?</em> Goya approaches his composition from a
          very macabre perspective, drawing on his own personal experiences with
          his health as well as the condition of Spanish politics at the time.
          Here, he makes it apparent that he is no stranger to the world of
          health problems, and this image specifically explores the relationship
          that Goya had with medical professionals.

        <p className="indent-8">
             Based on surviving letters from Goya’s life, scholars have been
          able to compile a list of symptoms that Goya suffered from, including
          physical ailments such as deafness and transient paralysis, as well as
          mental health issues like depression (Casey, 67). From this collection
          of symptoms, as well as the visual evidence seen in his art, recent
          doctors have attempted to diagnose Goya, citing illnesses such as
          typhoid fever, lead poisoning, and syphilis as possible conditions
          (Casey, 67). While there is extensive literature on the subject, it
          would be difficult to truly confirm any of these diagnoses in the
          present day; however, it is widely accepted that Goya suffered from
          depression. The fact that Goya went undiagnosed during the entirety of
          his lifetime supports the negative opinions that he held about
          doctors. Even without an exact diagnosis, though, viewers can still
          see how Goya’s ailments impacted his artistic career.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             <em>De que mal morira?</em> clearly illustrates the negative
          opinions that Goya held regarding medical professionals. In the
          etching, the physician is blatantly portrayed as an ass who is using
          his hoof to “somewhat indifferently” read the pulse of a deceased
          patient (Casey, 71). During Goya’s time, it was common for people to
          understand medical professionals as “killers of the healthy,” due to
          the inadequate qualifications that were required of these individuals
          (Casey, 72). Such inadequacies were only further perpetuated by the
          Spanish Inquisition that fueled the perception that this kind of
          education was neither necessary nor appropriate (Casey, 71). Because
          of this, it was certainly possible that Goya was dealing with truly
          incompetent doctors, thus his scathing representation of them as an
          incapable animal. Goya also distrusted Spanish politics, which he
          frequently targeted in his paintings and prints (Casey, 71).
          Interestingly, etchings on paper were not as highly valued as
          paintings, as the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando did not
          acknowledge their worth, so Goya had difficulty selling his prints
          (Rose, 309).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Because <em>Los Caprichos</em> stemmed from Goya’s own experiences,
          the prints in this series consistently display the raw emotion that is
          associated with Romanticism. The dark nature of{" "}
          <em>De que mal morira?</em> underscores this raw emotion, encouraging
          the viewer to approach the composition from a more melancholy
          perspective. Additionally, the individual markings that can be seen in
          the etching are not very precise, and they sometimes become chaotic,
          similar to{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/337725"

          >
            Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s prison etchings
          </a>
          . This messiness adds a level of unpredictability to the piece, and
          this sense of mystery is also enhanced by the shadows in the
          background. Behind the doctor and the deceased patient, there are two
          shadows of figures who are not seen in the foreground, which raises
          many questions from the viewer’s standpoint.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             While Goya is widely recognized today as a prominent artist from
          the Romantic era, his later body of work often went against the
          beliefs that are typically associated with the Romantic movement. For
          instance, scholars have identified the lack of landscape in Goya’s
          compositions, particularly his later pieces. Romantic artists have
          been known to pay close attention to nature in their images, yet in{" "}
          <em>De que mal morira?</em> Goya focuses much more on his human
          subjects than on their surroundings (Casey, 67). Moreover, the
          Romantic movement often opposed the Enlightenment, yet Goya was a
          strong advocate for the Enlightenment and its emphasis on reason and
          close observation. In this etching specifically, Goya draws attention
          to the importance of science and reasoning within the fields of
          medicine.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Another work that is closely related to <em>De que mal morira?</em>{" "}
          is Goya’s{" "}
          <em>
            <a
              href="https://collections.artsmia.org/art/1226/self-portrait-with-dr-arrieta-francisco-jose-de-goya-y-lucientes"
              target="_blank"
            >
              Self Portrait with Dr. Eugenio Garcia Arrieta
            </a>
          </em>
          . This painting was completed in 1820, much later than his{" "}
          <em>Los Caprichos</em> series, and in it, we can see how Goya’s
          outlook on doctors and medicine had changed since his experiences in
          the late 1790s. At this point, Goya was being treated by Dr. Arrieta,
          who he considered a close, trust-worthy friend (Rose, 314). The
          inscription in the lower portion of the painting reads “Goya in
          gratitude to his friend Arrieta for the skill and great care with
          which he saved his life in his acute and dangerous illness” (Rose,
          314). This inscription alone demonstrates how Goya’s opinion about
          doctors had shifted during the time when he was treated by Dr.
          Arrieta. In addition to the inscription, Goya’s depiction of the
          doctor is drastically different from his images in{" "}
          <em>Los Capricho</em>—images like <em>De que mal morira?</em> in which
          he represented the doctor as a literal ass, implying the figure’s
          incompetence at his job (Rose, 314). By the time his self-portrait
          with Dr. Arrieta was completed in 1820, however, Goya had come to
          recognize that doctors can be respectable, capable individuals. He has
          depicted Dr. Arrieta as a human, rather than an anthropomorphic ass,
          who was saving his life, rather than acting as a “killer of the
          healthy” (Rose, 314). Although Goya now viewed doctors in a more
          positive light, this self-portrait was also a highly romanticized
          image.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             While Goya’s personal beliefs may have shifted during the time that
          passed between the making of the etching and the self-portrait,
          several Romantic elements continued to prevail in both works. Because
          Goya identified so strongly with his ailments, a heightened emphasis
          on emotions is still present in the later painting. The subject matter
          remains closely related to Goya’s personal life and continues to
          exhibit the same raw emotion that infuses <em>De que mal morira?</em>.
          Moreover, in the self- portrait, the patient is Goya himself, holding
          on for dear life, rather than an unnamed deceased patient.
          Additionally, while the dark black background contributes to the
          gloomy atmosphere captured in the composition, it lacks the detail
          that one might expect in a Romantic painting; however, this lack of
          background remains consistent with the simple background seen in{" "}
          <em>De que mal morira?</em>, suggesting a limited connection to nature
          or a landscape.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Goya’s images can easily be compared to the works of other Romantic
          artists, such as Jacques-Louis David’s{" "}
          <em>
            <a
              href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/marat-assassinated/7QGjl9R141MCBw?hl=en"
              target="_blank"
            >
              The Death of Marat
            </a>
          </em>
          , which was painted in 1793, around the same time that Goya was
          working on his etchings for <em>Los Caprichos</em>. These images are
          similar in the way that they handle themes of death and distrust, and
          both can be interpreted as being politically charged artistic works.
          The Death of Marat features a deceased figure lying in a bathtub, and
          is positioned in a manner similar to Goya’s representation of the
          deceased patient in <em>De que mal morira?</em>. Additionally, David
          tells a story of deceit through <em>The Death of Marat</em>, as
          Jean-Paul Marat’s murderer was a member of the opposing political
          party who used lies and tricks to enter Marat’s chamber. This evokes a
          sense of distrust in David’s painting, which can easily be compared to
          the distrust that underscores Goya’s etching. Goya portrays the doctor
          as someone who should not be trusted with the lives of people.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             <em>De que mal morira?</em> is just one example of how Francisco
          Goya used art to comment on the condition of the world around him.
          Although Goya was working on <em>Los Caprichos</em> in the late 1700s,
          many of the themes we see in this series are still relevant in the
          world today. For instance, Goya’s candid exploration of mental health
          and his biting commentary on the ability or inability of doctors to
          deal with mental issues were bold and forward-thinking for their time.
          Today, discussions about mental health are becoming increasingly more
          prominent, and Goya can be considered a pioneering artist who tackled
          mental health issues in his art. Open conversations about mental
          health are received more positively now than they were in Goya’s time.
          Additionally, many people today are questioning the legitimacy of
          doctors rather than blindly following them, which is exactly what Goya
          was doing in his etching. Common medical practices have become
          extremely controversial, especially matters like vaccines, and people
          are publicly expressing their opinions every day, just like Goya was
          doing in <em>Los Caprichos</em>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             While Goya is typically associated with Romanticism, he did not
          allow the constraints of the movement to limit his artistic endeavors.
          He found inspiration in many aspects of his life, and he was motivated
          by his negative experiences to create passionate, emotionally-charged
          art.
