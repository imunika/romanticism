          Upon first glance, the English-born American painter Thomas Cole’s
          Chocorua’s Curse (1826) captivates us with its immense landscape
          rendered on such a small scale. The mountains seemingly go on beyond
          the horizon. In the foreground, Cole presents a scene equally as
          dramatic as the rugged mountains behind them. An indigenous man sits
          atop a high rock above three white settler men. The leader of the
          settlers looks up at the indigenous man ready to aim his rifle at him.
          This scene depicts the moment right before Chief Chocorua, the
          indigenous man, curses the settlers.

          Chocorua’s Curse is based on a tragic legend of conflict between white
          settlers and the indigenous community. The tale is set in New
          Hampshire in the county of Stafford, near present-day Albany. The
          protagonist of the story is a wise man named Cornelius Campbell who
          lived with his beautiful wife and children on a small settlement near
          the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Chocorua, the antagonist, a
          strong and well respected Native American also lived with his young
          son near the Campbell’s settlement with the rest of his tribe. Father
          and son would frequently visit the Campbell home. The young boy was
          very curious about the things that the white settlers owned, but
          unfortunately, one day, he mistakenly drank the poison that had been
          left out for wild foxes. Distraught over the death of his son,
          Chocorua vowed to take revenge on Cornelius Campbell and his family.
          One day, Campbell left his family to work in the fields, but upon his
          return he discovered his family had been killed. Filled with hatred
          for Chocorua, he decided that he too would exact his revenge. Campbell
          gathered a party of men and looked for Chocorua atop the rock he
          frequented. Campbell shot Chocorua, but before he died Chocorua cursed
          the white settlers, the land they lived on, the cattle they raised,
          and the homes they built. The curse came true and the settlers were
          forced to leave the land where they lived.

        <p className="indent-8">
          This tragic story was popularized by a book titled, The Token: A
          Christmas and New Year’s Present edited by Samuel Griswold Goodrich in
          1829 just a year before the Indian Removal Act (1830) would be put
          into place. A collection of stories and other writings, the book
          included the tale “Chocorua’s Curse” by Lydia Maria Child who had
          earlier written another popular story about the relationship between
          settlers and Native Americans in her novel, Hobomok, A Tale of Early
          Times that was published in 1824. Hobomok focused on the marriage
          between a Native American and a white settler woman who would give
          birth to an interracial child. The couple would later divorce and the
          woman would marry her first love, a white man. A romanticized version
          of something that may or may not have happened in reality, the story
          however highlights the tense relationship between settlers and Native
          Americans, a theme that also underscores Cole’s visual imaging of
          Chocorua’s Curse. In Goodrich’s book, Cole’s engraving with the same
          title as the story accompanies Child’s narrative version of Chocorua’s
          curse (Goodrich, 256-257).

        <p className="indent-8">
          Cole’s composition is highly Romantic in its subject and composition.
          Acclaimed for his American landscape paintings and also for
          co-founding the Hudson River School of painting, in 1819, Cole
          immigrated from England with his family. Later on in his adult life,
          he moved to Catskill, New York. Thanks to the New York merchant George
          Bruen, one of his early patrons, Cole’s career began to take off.
          Bruen sponsored Cole’s trip through the Hudson River Valley where the
          artist painted the landscapes he encountered. Cole was able to deftly
          capture the grandeur of the wilderness of New York. This caught the
          attention of other artists and patrons. He was commissioned to paint
          more pictures that displayed his talent for capturing the vastness of
          the American landscape, an example being the Course of Empire series
          (1833-1836) that depicts the evolution of western civilization. Other
          artists like Frederic Edwin Church also admired his landscape
          paintings and so, the Hudson River School of painting was born. Like
          Cole, Church and the other artists who belonged to this movement would
          emphasize the Romantic elements of their surroundings in their work
          (Avery, 5).

        <p className="indent-8">
          Returning to Cole’s Chocorua’s Curse, we see that Chocorua and the
          armed man gaze at each other while a trail of smoke appears from the
          rifle. The landscape takes up more than half of the composition and
          creates a backdrop that matches in drama the scene unfolding in the
          foreground. The engraving evokes feelings of danger and of awe. It
          also asks us, the viewers, to question our position in nature as we
          contemplate Chorocua at the center of the scene overlooking the men
          and the mountains behind them. The myth of Chocorua had already been
          circulating in local towns when Cole visited the legendary site of the
          curse. Strikingly, the story popularized by Child accentuates the
          concept of the “Noble Savage” that can be traced back to the
          eighteenth-century French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau who wrote
          about a liberated society completely uncorrupted by modernity
          (Vaughan, 18). Rousseau saw indigenous peoples as being more connected
          to nature, but disconnected from polite society. While it appears to
          ennoble the indigenous figure, Rousseau’s approach nevertheless
          dehumanizes indigenous peoples by perpetuating the idea that they are
          animalistic, violent, stupid, and impulsive. It was precisely such
          perceptions that led to acts of violence against indigenous peoples.
          They were also rooted in the notion of white superiority that
          overlooked the humanity and agency of other groups of people.

        <p className="indent-8">
          The Indigenous Nation which inhabited the land near the White
          Mountains of New Hampshire was the Abenaki nation. The land they lived
          on spread from southern Quebec to northern Massachusetts. The first
          European settlers relied on the indigenous people they encountered for
          trade and guidance in the Americas. Both parties wished for a
          harmonious relationship, but often ended conflicting with each other
          because of cultural misunderstandings. After a series of wars with the
          English settlers who continually encroached on their land, the
          Abenakis were forced to relocate. Despite the various peace treaties
          and land agreements, the English settlers often went back on their
          word and took advantage of the position they enjoyed because of their
          advanced weaponry (Institute for Native Justice). The mountain named
          Mount Chocorua is called that because it is believed that an
          indigenous man died there. Lydia Maria Child’s story became so popular
          that it was widely accepted as the truth; however, it is more likely
          that an indigenous person passed away there after a fall from the
          rocks. Cole too referred to the legend in his sketchbook:

              We set out to climb Chocorua peak... On the path through the wood,
              we came to windfalls, the track of the tornado, where every tree
              is laid prostrate. We came out, at length, to a lonely and
              de-serted clearing, just at the foot of the mountain. The cause of
              this abandonment is, they say, the poisonous effects of the water
              upon the cattle; the result, according to tradition, of the curse
              of Choco-rua, an Indian, from whom the peak, upon which he was
              killed by the whites, takes its name.

          Cole’s engraving is fraught with tension. The tension between the
          characters of the myth is one layer of tension. Next, we have the
          tension between the notions of “the old country” and “the new
          country,” and lastly the tension between man and nature. This small
          engraving reveals much of the history of the United States. One side
          of that story is the heroic white settler who sets out to make a home
          in a wild and untamed landscape, but this ignores the fact that there
          were already civilizations inhabiting the land and that there was
          nothing heroic about grabbing land. The conflicts, which arose between
          the settlers and the indigenous peoples of America, reveal a bloody
          and violent history which is reflected in the engraving as well as in
          the myth it was based on.

          Cornelius Campbell and Chocorua started a vicious cycle of revenge
          over the deaths of their family members. Cole’s image captures the
          moment of tension just before Campbell takes the life of Chocorua and
          the curse is placed. It also draws attention to the notion of
          “discovery” that is embedded into the hagiography of the United
          States. The white man has “discovered” an uncivilized being, the
          indigenous man who becomes symbolic of the discovery of the New World
          by white colonists from the Old Country. It is up to the settlers from
          the Old Country to “civilize” and conquer this new and beautiful
          landscape and its peoples so that they can profit from their
          discoveries.

          In Cole’s composition, the scale of the landscape when compared to the
          size of the figures, compels us to think about the power dynamic
          between man and nature. The white man “civilizes” nature through
          technological advancements that in reality harm the environment. In
          the engraving, the white settler stands to the right of a broken tree,
          a motif that can be interpreted as a testament to the power of
          colonization. For the broken tree might be read as a symbol of the
          changes ushered in by the white settlers, its sharp broken-off
          branches conveying a sense of foreboding. What will come next is a
          bloody death for Chocorua. Quite simply, change will come about
          violently. Chocorua sits on the rock defenseless against the gun of
          the white man.

          In 2016, indigenous- and environmentalist- activists joined forces at
          Standing Rock, North Dakota to protest an oil pipeline, the Dakota
          Access Pipeline (DAPL) which could pollute the drinking water for the
          nearby Sioux reservation if it were to spill (NPR, Jeff Brady). This
          protest garnered nationwide attention as the battle for potable
          drinking water continued. Activists successfully marketed for their
          cause on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram by using
          the hashtag “#NODAPL.” Under the Obama administration, activists were
          triumphant in being able to deny a permit which would allow for the
          construction of the pipeline; however, the current Trump
          administration reversed that decision in 2016 and construction was
          allowed to continue. Images of activists being sprayed with water by
          using hoses in freezing temperatures are just one example of the
          violence that occurred so recently at Standing Rock (Vox, Plumer).
          Activists have also claimed part of the land that the pipeline
          construction must pass through, as belonging to eight indigenous
          tribes under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 (Vox, Plumer). Despite
          tremendous efforts on the part of the activists at Standing Rock, the
          United States government has once again taken advantage of their power
          for capitalistic profit. The histories and cultural frameworks of
          indigenous communities continue to be overlooked and violently
          suppressed, bringing to mind the tensions that Cole drew attention to
          more than a century ago in his composition, Chocorua’s Curse.
