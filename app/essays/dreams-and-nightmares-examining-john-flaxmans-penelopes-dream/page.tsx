          when Minerva or Athena, suddenly conjures a physical presence in front
          of a sleeping Penelope in order to relay a message concerning
          Odysseus, Penelope’s husband. The illustration is conveniently titled{" "}
          <em>Penelope’s Dream</em>. This is one of Flaxman’s many illustrations
          of scenes within the well-known Greek epic. Returning to antiquity or
          the era of ancient Greece, <em>The Odyssey</em> is an epic poem by the
          ancient Greek poet, Homer. The story follows Odysseus, the king of
          Ithaca and soldier of the Trojan War, on his journey back home
          immediately after the fall of Troy. While Odysseus undertakes his
          ten-year long journey to return home, his wife, Penelope, finds
          herself dodging troublesome suitors who want her hand in marriage and
          the crown to the city-state of Ithaca. Flaxman’s revival of Homer’s
          classical epic reflects the renewed appreciation for classical ideas,
          subjects, and elements in eighteenth- and nineteenth- century Europe.

             Flaxman’s etching sits on a 168 mm by 245 mm page, which is about
          the normal size of a compact book page. The size of the print quickly
          shows the visual interpretation of the text, which is quite complex in
          comparison to the initial impression of an ostensibly simple
          composition. Nevertheless, this initial impression of simplicity gives
          the viewer just enough stimuli to move along in the story and follow
          the illustrations that are to come, without being distracted by other
          visual elements. However, if one were to look more closely at the
          composition, there is an exactness and brevity in the line work that
          conveys a sense of tidy cleanness. Flaxman focuses on the single
          encounter between Athena and Penelope, and desists from crowding the
          scene with more than it needs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             The viewer is presented with the visual representation of the bed
          that Penelope sleeps on – a hint of the setting in which the encounter
          takes place. Then, in the center of the print, Penelope is interrupted
          in the midst of her slumber, while a single oil lamp burns in the left
          corner of the image. The bed and the lamp remain the only inanimate
          objects; however, one can still feel the flickering of the fire as
          Athena suddenly rushes into the scene. Although the print seems to
          lack spatial detail, our imagination works to complete the scene in
          our minds just as for a novel that only gives so much detail, it is
          the reader that creates the image of characters and landscapes as best
          to match the details of the story. It is also by filling in the gaps
          of our imagination that we acknowledge the intensity of Penelope’s
          emotions, as she lies upset about the unknown whereabouts of her
          husband, which are settled by Athena’s arrival. The goddess herself is
          almost depicted as a hero, her hand wavering over the head of Penelope
          in a savior-like motion. Nevertheless, this immortal form that appears
          before Penelope is quite frightening. Although a divine being, Athena
          appears to be ghost-like and swiftly visits Penelope just as she falls
          asleep. In the flickering light of the oil lamp, Athena gifts Penelope
          with the vision that Odysseus will return and vanquish the numerous
          suitors at her doorstep.

        <p className="indent-8">
             <em>Penelope’s Dream</em> exemplifies the key Romantic idea that
          reality and illusion become blurred in dreams in which new scenarios
          that we think about on a subconscious level finally have freedom to
          reign. How then might this single illustration by Flaxman reflect some
          recognizable themes of Romanticism, most notably in the state of
          dreaming? While <em>Penelope’s Dream</em> is an illustration of a
          specific incident in an epic, itself a multitude of stories within a
          single story that typically follows the journey of a lone hero (also a
          Romantic motif), Flaxman emphasized the dream-like state to heighten
          the intensity of the encounter between Athena and Penelope. The sphere
          of the subconscious mind or the act of dreaming was a recurring
          Romantic theme that we can also see in Henry Fuseli’s{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.dia.org/art/collection/object/nightmare-45573"
            target="_blank"
          >
            <em>The Nightmare</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1781) and Francisco de Goya’s{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/338473"
            target="_blank"
          >
            <em>The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1797-1799). Both Fuseli and Goya accentuated the human repression of
          strong emotions such as fear. Somehow, Flaxman’s illustration is less
          about the horror of the subconscious and more about the ethereal
          quality of dreaming, represented by the airborne Athena. Furthermore,
          Athena becomes a personified form of a dream since it is she who
          brings the vision to Penelope.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             At another level, Flaxman’s Penelope is visited by what can be
          interpreted as a spectral Athena, who is also disguised as Iphthima
          the fair (Icarius’s daughter). Athena approaches Penelope in her most
          vulnerable state, whilst she is sleeping. It is a phantom Athena that
          hovers over a Penelope, becoming somewhat of a representation of a
          hallucination for Penelope, who is tormented in her dreams about the
          current state of her husband Odysseus. Athena being depicted as a
          ghost-like figure is yet another romantic image because it channels
          the emotions of fear and terror that all mortals experience. Keeping
          in mind that dreams emerge once an individual becomes fully
          unconscious, we can interpret Athena as a physical manifestation of
          Penelope’s fears, since it is Athena who arrives to bring the message
          of Odysseus’s destiny.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Returning to Fuseli’s <em>The Nightmare</em> and Goya’s{" "}
          <em>The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</em>, we find that the
          former depicts a distressed woman in deep slumber. A demonic figure
          rests on her chest, this very incubus possibly being the cause for her
          vivid and haunting nightmares. In the dark corner, a horse adds to the
          haunting atmosphere. In Goya’s{" "}
          <em>The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</em>, an etching like{" "}
          <em>Penelope’s Dream</em>, the sleeping figure appears to be tormented
          in his dreams by a group of animals that include owls and bats. Both{" "}
          <em>The Nightmare</em> and{" "}
          <em>The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</em> have an ominous air,
          something that Flaxman’s careful and clean line rendering lacks.
          Nevertheless, all these images highlight just how troublesome the
          subconscious can truly be to a human being. It is where our deepest
          fears lie and when one is asleep, these fears and horrific feelings
          come to the surface.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Unlike Fuseli and Goya, however, Flaxman not only evokes dreams, he
          also incorporates sculptural renderings of fabric into his
          illustration. Flaxman’s artistic choice may be due to his nine-year
          stay in Rome during an early period of his life when he was exposed to
          classical sculpture. His emphasis on line became his signature style.
          To this end, Flaxman’s graphic illustration is similar to what we see
          today in graphic novels. Images like <em>Penelope’s Dream</em> can be
          considered the precedent to contemporary versions of an original
          visual reading in which the artist tells a compelling story through
          images and dialogue. Today, artists and writers illustrate their
          poetry books as seen in the poet{" "}
          <a href="https://rupikaur.com/pages/milk-and-honey/" target="_blank">
            Rupi Kaur’s <em>Milk and Honey</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (2014). Kaur herself experiments with line but in a looser manner than
          Flaxman. As far as dreams are concerned, there have been new
          discoveries and experiments with dreams such as the idea of lucid
          dreaming in which individuals are aware that they are dreaming and
          through this awareness, they learn to control the elements of their
          dream. In addition, modern Science Fiction movies have also been based
          on dreaming and dream infiltration as we see in the military tactics
          depicted in <em>Inception</em> (2010), a film that explores a
          different realm of the dream state in which the subconscious is broken
          down into a series of levels of consciousness. Dreams and the latent
          parts of the mind continue to be romanticized in modern culture,
          especially as science advances and contemporary artists, writers, and
          film makers continue to explore dreams in their own works.
