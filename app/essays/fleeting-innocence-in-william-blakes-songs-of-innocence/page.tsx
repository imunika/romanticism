          , published in 1789. I loved the fact that Blake created these books
          of both his art and his poetry. When you combine art and poetry with
          something like childhood, as Blake did, you are set for a particularly
          emotional experience. I have always been moved by children’s abilities
          to process the world through untouched, untainted, innocent eyes.
          Blake capitalizes on this notion and makes it the focal point of his
          book.

             When I ventured into the{" "}

            Special Collections Research Center
          </a>{" "}
          to actually see the book itself, I was kindly greeted at the front
          desk. “Are you the researcher?” I was asked. I was slightly taken
          aback by this dignified title. Wow, me, Miranda, a researcher? So
          fancy. I then sat down and was greeted by Blake’s work. The cover page
          presents us with an innocent, mystical image of sorts. In the lower
          left corner, a woman sits holding a book— presumably{" "}
          <em>The Book of Life</em>— while two children eagerly kneel and take
          in the book.

          branches merging with the words. The words in turn echo the branches
          of the tree, suggesting that innocence and nature are connected.
          Within the tree, there are tiny angels and a piper. They comfortably
          bask in the light, watching this scene play out. In the background
          lies a placid pastoral landscape. The sky changes tones as the eyes
          move from the top to the bottom, giving us a pastel palette that
          starts from light sky blue, then eases to an almost light, violet pink
          for a very brief period, and ends with a fading yellow before the
          field setting begins.

             From the cover page, we move to the introduction, which is
          important to unpack, as it is, like the cover, our first point of
          entry into Blake’s collection of exploratory poems and visuals that
          ruminate on what it means to be an “innocent” child within the
          beauties of the natural world. Robert Musante draws attention to the
          rich symbolism in this section of the <em>Songs of Innocence</em>—a
          symbolism that can be found throughout the poems and visuals that make
          up <em>Songs of Innocence</em> (Musante, 12-13). The imagery we
          encounter in the introduction is similar to what we find in the title
          page, for here too we come across a piper and a child requesting him
          to play a tune for him:

             It is interesting that a child is commanding the piper to do
          something, though it is an innocent command. It further reveals the
          child’s naiveté because this could be seen as impolite, though in this
          case, it isn’t (Musante, 14). From here onwards, we get hints of the
          darkness that is to come in the poems of this book, which are
          especially explored in <em>Songs of Experience</em> that followed in
          1794. The piper lists all the things he will need to do in order to
          complete this task of playing the child a song. The things he lists
          are all material objects, for example a pen. This is a sad reminder of
          the commodities we come into contact with regardless of if we want to.
          We can’t help but interact with the industrialized world as it is a
          world into which we are integrated. The piper’s response is subtle
          preview of what is to come in the rest of <em>Songs of Innocence </em>
          and<em> Songs of Experience</em>.

        <p className="indent-8">
             Following his introduction to the <em>Songs of Innocence</em>,
          Blake continues to subtly remind us through his poetry that innocence
          cannot be constant. Blake asks us, his readers, to contemplate what
          comes after this pure state of child-like wonder. Unfortunately, in
          Blake’s eyes, it is the more bitter, realized state of understanding
          that childhood purity can’t last forever. In{" "}
          <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, the loss of innocence is also touched
          upon in a poem called, “The Little Black Boy” in which a little boy
          comes to terms with racism and the gross injustice that many people
          are forced to face in the world (McQuail, 90). Blake’s{" "}
          <em>Innocence</em> isn’t actually as innocent as it appears to be.

             In <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, we have children interacting with
          the natural world, and unlike other explorations of this subject by
          other Romantics, Blake’s rendering emphasizes childhood as something
          magical and holy, though there are hints of darkness on the horizon.
          The tree acts as a protective canopy for the children to find joy in{" "}
          <em>The Book of Life</em>. Integrating man (in this case, child) and
          the natural world to produce (in this case) such a harmonious state
          was one of the hallmarks of Romanticism.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             After learning about Blake’s works, I had a slew of questions about
          Blake himself. Who was this grown man who was so fascinated by
          child-like ways and who was able to see the world through child-like
          eyes? Blake wasn’t only an artist and a poet. He was also an engraver.
          He didn’t have any children with his wife, Catherine. Perhaps Blake’s
          works were their children. Before Catherine met Blake, she was
          illiterate. But Blake, being the doting, caring husband he was, taught
          her how to read and write. From there, a business partnership was born
          in addition to their marital partnership. Catherine even continued
          Blake’s legacy after he died (Langridge, 9-11). She is quoted
          reminding Blake that he experienced the type of divinity he hoped to
          evoke in the <em>Songs of Innocence</em> when he was a boy. “You know,
          dear, the first time you saw God was when you were four years old, and
          He put his head to the window and set you screaming” (Langridge, 2).
          Blake’s love for his wife was a huge influence on his work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             When I thought about other potential museum collections to explore
          and relate to <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, my mind immediately went to
          the art museum I am lucky enough to have almost in my backyard— the
          Princeton University Art Museum. Currently on display there are two
          exhibitions that are very relevant to the idea of innocence. The first
          is{" "}
          <a
            href="https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/exhibitions/3415"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Gainsborough’s Family Album
          </a>{" "}
          that includes a portrait of Thomas Gainsborough’s daughters titled,{" "}
          <em>
            Mary and Margaret Gainsborough, the Artist’s Daughters, Playing with
            a Cat
          </em>{" "}
          (1760) that evokes childhood innocence. Gainsborough painted his
          daughters with a delicacy that suggests he saw them in a light of
          wonder. This wonder was especially captured for viewers in Blake’s
          cover art as he produced a soft image of children appreciating our
          world in a way many can’t because they have been exposed to such
          harshness. The second exhibition,{" "}
          <a
            href="https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/exhibitions/3581"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Confronting Childhood
          </a>
          , includes another work that resonates with Blake’s thoughts and
          messages: a photograph by Sally Mann titled{" "}
          <em>Under Blueberry Hill</em> (1951). Here, we have a black and white
          image of a young boy sitting in a pool of water, staring directly at
          the camera. To me, this image is somber and emotional. It seems to
          convey that childhood is something that can also be dark and
          reflective. Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence</em> is a preview for this
          darkness that Mann evokes through this striking black and white image.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             The innocence that Blake captured and wanted us to appreciate is
          something to hold onto because it doesn’t last. Children are
          unfortunately exposed to various toxic things at an early age, be it
          the internet, cell phones, or social media. As a child, one of my
          favorite times of day was right before bedtime, when my mom or dad
          would read to me one of my favorite stories before bedtime. I loved
          books like <em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em> and{" "}
          <em>Comet’s Nine Lives</em>. I think Blake’s work connects to the
          literature we read our children today, but instead of creating times
          of innocence through the works we read to our kids, Blake was
          examining it, and reflecting on it, and asking us to behold that
          innocence, because it might soon be gone.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             That being said, <em>Songs of Innocence</em> poses a hopeful
          message about the divine spirit of childhood. This spirit is one to
          admire and use as a tool for hope. Though it quickly disappears, we
          must not forget about the innocence of children as they grow up in the
          natural world. Blake has given us something holy in his own way in
          that he was so taken by this wonder and purity, he preserved it for
          readers in <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, starting with its cover page.
