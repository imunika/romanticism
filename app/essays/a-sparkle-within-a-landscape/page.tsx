          In an 1876 letter, Samuel Palmer wrote that “the charm of etching is
          the glimmering through of the white paper even in the shadows; so that
          almost everything either sparkles or suggests sparkle … those thousand
          little luminous eyes which peer through a finished linear etching”
          (Art Gallery of New South Wales). This “sparkle” is undeniably present
          in Palmer’s etching, <em>The Early Ploughman</em> (1861) in which the
          morning sky glimmers in the background as birds flock to an
          unbeknownst destination. Men are hard at work tending to their oxen as
          a woman carrying a pitcher of water watches them in the shadows.

             Palmer, as illustrated by this image and many more, was a master
          artist. Born in 1805 during the heyday of British Romanticism, he was
          influenced by poets like William Wordsworth, Samuel Coleridge, and
          Lord Byron and great artists like J. M. W. Turner. A precocious artist
          who exhibited his paintings at the Royal Academy when he was only
          fourteen years old, Palmer, in time, became dissatisfied with his
          artistic direction. He met John Linnell, another well-known landscape
          artist, and he began to study prints made by the acclaimed German
          artist Albrecht Dürer. But it wasn’t until Palmer met William Blake
          that he fully embraced Romanticism.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Palmer and Blake were two English artists who met during
          contrasting periods in their lives. Palmer was young whereas Blake was
          old. Palmer was successful, selling his artworks to high-end
          clientele, and admired by the mainstream art society. Blake was
          obscure, impoverished, anti-establishment, and rejected by the Royal
          Academy. Palmer was stimulated by the environment surrounding him.
          Blake, on the other hand, was creating his own mythologies. But both
          artists drew attention to the significance of the natural environment.
          They questioned mankind’s experience with nature at a time when it was
          rapidly changing because of human intervention. To these artists, the
          environment was a divine entity crafted by God’s hands. Palmer and
          Blake can be seen as early ecologists – they wanted to preserve
          natural scenery and protect the traditional ways of rural life from
          the onslaught of modern civilianization.

            <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>
          </a>{" "}
          (1794), he intricately combines visuals with words while portraying
          the dual elements of innocence (childhood) and experience (adulthood).
          Poetry and hand-colored prints reveal the tension between human
          passion and repression. The rhythms are simple and the images of
          children, animals, and nature are heavily influenced by the ornate
          illustrations found in medieval books of hours. At another level,{" "}
          <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> reflects Blake’s
          political and spiritual beliefs. Here too, Blake expresses radical
          thoughts about poverty, child labor, and the complex correspondence
          between state and church.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, among other
          works by the artist, would greatly influence Palmer even after Blake’s
          death. Palmer thought Blake’s wood engravings were “visions of little
          dells, and nook, and corners of Paradise; models of the exquisitist
          pitch of intense poetry. I thought of their light and shade, and
          looking upon them I found no word to describe it. Intense depth,
          solemnity, and vivid brilliancy only coldly and partially describe
          them” (Wilcox, 11).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Palmer wasn’t just a mere follower of Blake. He added his own
          perceptions to his work. His style, although mostly constant, changed
          as he experienced life. The Reform Bill of 1832, which shifted voting
          rights away from the small rural boroughs controlled by the
          aristocracy and landed gentry to the emerging industrialized cities,
          deeply affected his images. Using various techniques, Palmer added
          vivid detail, beauty, and roughness to what others saw as the mundane
          English landscape. He believed deeper perception was gained through
          the resources of the imagination. He was a townsman by birth but
          always carried a great appreciation for the rural lifestyle.
          Regardless, his scenes were always reflective of his own environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Palmer created multiple versions of <em>The Early Ploughman</em>.
          The image evokes an Italianate feel through the cypress-like trees
          framing its composition as in a Claudian landscape. Palmer started
          creating this plate in 1861 while living in Kensington and continued
          to modify it sporadically throughout his life. The same year, Palmer
          began living in turmoil. His favorite son, Thomas More Palmer, died at
          the young age of nineteen. The artist never fully recovered from this
          tragedy. Palmer’s vision, which began as vibrant and vivid, became
          darker, moodier, but still romantic. He re-bit{" "}
          <em>The Early Ploughman</em>’s plate to intensify the sharp contrast
          between light and shadow.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Palmer’s usage of light in <em>The Early Ploughman</em> boldly
          separates the foreground, midground, and background. At the center of
          the image, he captures an intimate view of a farmer working on his
          land. The farmer cares for his oxen without the help of machinery. His
          back is turned away from us as are his oxen. Palmer places us as
          explorers or observers in the composition. He positions the plowman
          and oxen on a slight serpentine curve, allowing for our eyes to wander
          and find distant figures within the image. Another farmer can be seen
          plowing in another narrow field. A silhouette of a mysterious woman is
          somewhat hidden, placed in front of layers of trees, for the viewer to
          discover.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Strikingly, in his composition, Palmer creates a sense of motion
          and sound. A tree bends in the breeze, so we can hear and see its
          rustling leaves. As a flock of birds flies away from the oxen, we can
          hear their wings flap. The birds fly towards man-made structures
          drawing our attention to them. A river flows under a lone bridge. A
          ruined arch, representing nature’s power over humankind, is
          illustrated at distance on a seemly deserted hill, illuminated by the
          sky. The sky itself is complex. Palmer depicts the moody dawn, not in
          monotonous shades of black, grey, or white, but with curved and
          meandering strands of light and dark.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Palmer emphasizes the relationship between humans and their natural
          environment. The scene is untouched by industry. It highlights hard
          work, intensive labor, and the farmer’s attachment to nature. At a
          time when portrait painting valorized the rich and powerful, Palmer
          gave value to the common rural folk like the hard-working farmer.
          Moreover, he depicted an everyday scene as if it were a new sight, a
          new discovery.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Palmer’s son, Alfred Herbert Palmer, began reprinting the plate for{" "}
          <em>The Early Ploughman</em> in 1873 under Frederick Goulding’s
          instructions. Through special inks and printing techniques, these
          prints were striking, familiar, but different from the originals.
          Palmer would be largely forgotten soon after his death in 1881. Alfred
          burned a great number of sketchbooks, notebooks, and other original
          works. Eventually, his father’s work was rediscovered. Palmer’s pieces
          are bold and feel modern, yet are two centuries old. His deft handling
          of form and instinct for color inspired a multitude of English artist
          and brought a resurgence back to the importance of landscape.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Palmer’s focus on the farmer continues to be relevant today. We
          continue to portray farmers as national heroes, who provide food for
          our growing population. While tractors and other industrial machines
          are still used to aid agriculture, there’s now a resurgence of more
          natural processes and farming techniques. Organic and farm-to-table
          initiatives have become buzz words as consumers look for more natural
          foods free of manmade chemicals, preservatives, and pesticides.
          Consumers are increasingly interested in buying more local produce
          from nearby farms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
             Palmer’s depiction of rural landscapes in the age of technological
          advance remains strikingly relevant. Philosophers, writers, and artist
          question the definition of beauty as our world continues to become
          more industrialized. As society becomes more modern and focused on
          technology, nature is impacted often negatively. There is an
          exponential focus on innovation and creating and consuming new
          products. By comparison, the attempt to preserve nature lags behind.
          Global climate change is a reality and happening quickly.

          recyclable plastics and transforms them into flamboyantly colored

          placed in unconventional everyday places. New Yorkers can encounter
          their neon-colored bears placed aside the United Nation building and

          , Cracking Art examines technological innovation, while simultaneously
          questioning the levels of production and the value of aesthetics in an

          awareness to environmentalism through an abstract, yet direct, medium.
          Cracking Art asks us to ponder: what is real, what is fake, and what
          will happen if we allow for our environment to continue to be
          destroyed? These seem to be the very same questions that Palmer asked
          in the nineteenth century.
