          Envision yourself journeying through Italy as a European aristocrat in
          the 18th century. Your next stop is the renowned city of Rome, the
          center of the once great empire that ruled most of Europe and Northern
          Africa. Surrounded by the grandeur of classical monuments, you come
          across the triumphal arch probably built between 312-315 CE by the
          Roman emperor Constantine and you request a work of art from an
          established artist to show your friends and family back home of what
          you saw. An elaborate etching of the arch is what you receive. Not
          only is it an accurate depiction of the arch, it also contains details
          of peasants and goats wandering in the scene. Constantine’s arch
          stands tall even as plants and shrubs grow upon it. When you display
          the work, it is recognized as an etching by none other than Giovanni
          Battista Piranesi, the acclaimed Italian graphic artist from the 18th
          century.

          Giovanni Battista Piranesi went beyond the formalistic qualities of
          architectural sketches to incorporate visual details that relied on
          his vibrant imagination. Piranesi began to develop a style that
          resurrected classical architecture as romantic relics (Thompson).
          Romantic in this context refers to the passage of time, wanderlust,
          and scenic imagery. At an early age Piranesi received structural and
          engineering training from his maternal uncle. He started in Venice
          then later moved to Rome in 1740 to work as an apprentice to Giuseppe
          Vasi, an acclaimed engraver and architect known for his vedute or
          views of Rome (Thompson). It was during this apprenticeship that
          Piranesi began to make prints and develop an appreciation for Roman
          architecture. Piranesi began to create etchings of Roman landmarks and
          later started the project Vedute di Roma (Views of Rome), an expansive
          body of work produced between 1748 to 1778 in which classical
          architecture was infused with romantic tropes like ruins and people
          roaming among ancient monuments (Thompson). Piranesi’s images had
          begun to display a style that focused on serene scenes in which nature
          appeared to take over classical Roman buildings. At the same time,
          however, his prints emphasized both the architectural integrity and
          appeal of ancient buildings.

        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          That being said, Piranesi was not the first to develop these types of
          fantastic architectural scenes. The melancholy scenes of ruins in a
          landscape can be traced back to Venetian artists such as Giovanni
          Antonio Canal, also known as Canaletto, an Italian painter known for
          his paintings of cities like Rome, London, and Venice (Murray, 17).
          These Venetian traditions would leave lasting impressions on Piranesi,
          long after he had moved to Rome. Then, under Vasi’s mentorship, he was
          able to translate these artistic influences into an aesthetic language
          of commerce and romance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Piranesi’s Vedute di Roma can be split into two phases. In the first
          phase, Piranesi focused on the more modern architecture of Rome. The
          Veduta dell’Arco di Costantino (View of the Arch of Constantine) was
          produced in the second phase where Piranesi devoted his time to
          measuring and drawing the ruins of ancient Rome (Murray, 44). In this
          second phase, there was a subtle shift in how he composed and framed
          architectural structures and ancient sites. By then, Piranesi had
          developed a taste for nomadic scenes of travelers and commoners
          juxtaposed with the grandeur of ancient Roman architecture (Murray,
          44).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Such compositional techniques accentuate the mortality of life against
          the lasting architecture of ancient Rome. Piranesi created these
          scenes by framing a dramatic perspective in order to accentuate scale
          and size. He also emphasized the surrounding plant growth to show
          nature reclaiming the land, a visual motif that simultaneously draws
          attention to the passage of time (Kirk, 240). It is also important to
          understand that the main focus in Veduta dell’Arco di Costantino is
          the arch itself and the surrounding scene is primarily a figment of
          the imagination based on a real monument. Piranesi was accurately
          documenting the architecture of Rome. However, by emphasizing romantic
          tropes like the passage of time alongside a dramatic perspective, he
          managed to showcase the vestiges of ancient architecture as unique
          story-telling devices in contemporary Rome.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Besides the overall romantic tenor of his work, the Veduta dell’Arco
          di Costantino serves as an accurate documentation of the arch.
          Piranesi carefully studied and measured the arch to a critical point
          where his architectural drawings became plausible records of existing
          roman architecture (Cordaro, et. al., 43). The Venetian artistic style
          and traditions found in his etchings resemble those encountered in
          Venetian paintings. In his earlier body of work, Piranesi reproduced
          common moments of human interactions amongst the lower class and used
          atmospheric impressions rendered by chiaroscuro in order to create
          perspective (Cordaro, et. al., 37). However, it is his mastery of
          perspective and line work that began to round out his mix of Venetian
          traditions and Roman architectural artistry.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Piranesi’s renderings of Rome stylistically resemble paintings made by
          his predecessor Giovanni Paolo Panini. Fantastic Landscape with Ruins
          and Figures (1715) attributed to the School of Giovanni Paolo Panini
          and housed in the Syracuse University Art Galleries reveals a visual
          language that bears a striking similarity to what we encounter in
          Piranesi’s Veduta dell’Arco di Costantino. Both are images of ancient
          ruins dotted with figures that create a serene and melancholy
          atmosphere. The obvious differences would be the medium: one is an oil
          painting while the other is an etching. It can be argued that the oil
          painting is less focused on the architecture; instead, it emphasizes
          the interactions between the human figures seen in the composition. A
          golden light draws our attention to the fashionably dressed figures
          who appear to be enjoying life next to the coast and ruins of tall
          arches. By contrast, there is a clear indication of focus on
          architecture in the Veduta dell’Arco Costantino because the arch is
          centered and interwoven with other subtle details that the eye picks
          up as it wanders through the print. That said, both images reveal a
          taste for architectural precision and serene landscape settings.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-8">
          Turning now to Canaletto, the Venetian artist who influenced
          Piranesi’s later style, and who was a painter and printmaker renowned
          for his landscape views, we find a talented artist who understood the
          importance of patronage as well as the mastery of technique. Canaletto
          sold his work to highly regarded aristocrats and patrons (Baetjer, 3),
          something that Piranesi would also do in later decades. Piazza San
          Marco (late 1720s) by Canaletto is a perfect example of a casual
          public scene and particular tradition of tonal lighting. Again, we see
          subtle similarities in both Piranesi and Canaletto’s works. Both focus
          on scenic imagery with fine architectural depictions and both share
          strong contrasts in light and shadow. But, true to his style, Piranesi
          emphasized the details of architecture. The similarities between
          Piranesi and Panini may be obvious, but the differences between their
          works are subtle. We might speculate that Piranesi’s ability to build
          upon Venetian traditions of painting architectural scenes together
          with his proficiency in recreating architectural detail on paper,
          helped him create his famous views of Rome.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="indent-8">
          Piranesi was a visionary printmaker who would influence later
          generations of artists. Even if it may not be immediately noticeable,
          there is a connection between the souvenir etchings of Piranesi’s
          Roman views and the views we see in contemporary postcards. Wealthy
          Grand Tourists who traveled throughout Italy sought to memorialize
          their visits to classical monuments by collecting souvenirs like
          Piranesi’s prints that reminded them of those grand edifices of the
          past in an otherwise contemporary city (Holden, 99). To this day, the
          tourist industry is still an enormous source of income for many cities
          and countries. Simple souvenirs like postcards offer similar views as
          those found in Piranesi’s Vedute di Roma because they are images that
          represent historic landmarks and views of scenic tourist spots.
          Tourists attractions like the Eiffel Tower or even the Colosseum
          continue to produce and promote similar monument iconic images that
          are sold as souvenirs. However, it can be argued that postcards are
          rather cheap and more accessible to everyone than a Piranesi print.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-8">
          Giovanni Battista Piranesi started out as an aspiring architect. He
          developed his pictorial skills in Venice, before mastering his
          technical abilities in Rome with its ancient and contemporary
          architecture. All of this culminated in Piranesi creating a unique
          style for serene scenes with accurate depictions of historical
          monuments. Eventually, Piranesi embarked upon the etching series
          Vedute di Roma, a body of work that depicted ancient Roman
          architecture in contemporary Rome but with fictional elements (Holden,
          99). These etchings catered to the Grand Tourist who enjoyed
          collecting accurate portrayals of monuments in romanticized and
          melancholy settings. Like postcards, Piranesi’s works can be
          considered architectural documents, but with a strong preference for
          fantasy and fiction.
