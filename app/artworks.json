    "Description": "Samuel Palmer created The Early Ploughman (1861) in the middle of his etching career. Bringing an Italianate feel to a British landscape, he depicts men hard at work tending to their oxen as a woman watches carrying a water pitcher against the early morning sky. He emphasizes the simplistic relationship between rural folk and their natural environments during a time of increasing industrialization. Various versions of the etching were created by Palmer as well by his son, Alfred Herbert Palmer.",

    "Description": "The Veduta dell’Arco di Costantino (View of the Arch of Constantine) is an etching by Giovanni Battista Piranesi from his larger corpus of prints, Vedute di Roma (Views of Rome). An impression of this print can be found in the collections of the Syracuse University Art Galleries. Piranesi’s Veduta dell’Arco di Costantino is an example of Piranesi’s detailed yet romanticized representations of ancient monuments of Rome. Piranesi used romantic motifs as story-telling devices while at the same time, maintaining the architectural integrity of the sites he chose to depict.",
